      "Content": "## The ADCC - Plain English Explanation\n\nThe charter of the Committee is to commemorate our fallen heroes and to honour our surviving veterans.\n\nOur objects are:\n\n- The recognition of the gallant courage displayed by the Australian sons and daughters in fighting for the preservation of liberty and civilisation.\n- The relief, by way of donation, of aged war veterans and their widows, including those suffering from dementia.\n- The commemoration of our fallen and the acknowledgment of the suffering of our wounded.\n- The conduct of patriotic ceremonies in every town in Queensland on ANZAC Day, the 25th day of April.\n- The encouragement of religious bodies to observe ANZAC Day by such religious service as each body shall decide.\n- The care and upkeep of graves of ex-Service personnel whose death was not accepted as due to War Service by the Repatriation Commission.\n\nWhilst this is an accurate quote from the Constitution, how does it translate into deeds and who are the patriotic volunteer citizens behind this unique Australian organisation?\n\n### In short, what is a plain-English explanation of the ADCC?\n\n**The main activities of the Committee focus on:**\n\n- conducting our Annual Badge Appeal with the support of the Queensland sub-branches of the Returned & Services League of Australia (the “RSL”) and other ex-Service organisations.\n- promoting the Spirit of ANZAC through education and publicity, and\n- providing subsidies and grants in accordance with our charter and objects.\n\nBehind the scenes, some 29 individual or corporate members comprise the General Committee.\n\nA minimum five-person Executive is elected each year to conduct the hands-on business of the organisation.\n\nAt the annual meeting, the General Committee performs a role similar to that of a Board of Directors; that is, it reviews the results of the Executive for the previous year and provides guidance for the next.\n\nAll members are patriotic volunteers who perform their honorary tasks as an ongoing citizens’ gift of the people to the war veterans of Queensland.\n\nMembership is by invitation.\n\nThe composition as at 1 October 2016, was:\n\n**Three ex-officio appointments:**\n\n- Our Patron — The Governor of Queensland, His Excellency the Honourable Paul de Jersey AC\n- Our Chairman — The Premier of Queensland, the Honourable Annastacia Palaszczuk MP\n- Our Vice-Chairman — The Leader of the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament, Mrs Deb Frecklington MP\n\n**The Executive Committee presently consists of:**\n\n- President — Colonel David Smith AM (Retd)\n- Secretary— Mr Neil Cook\n- Treasurer — Mr Sean Maher\n- ANZAC Ceremonials Committee Chair — Colonel David Smith AM (Retd)\n- Assistant Ceremonies Officer – Commander Jeff Booker RAN (Retd)\n- Museum and Displays Officer – Captain Adele Catts\n- Memorials Officer – Commander Darryl Neild OAM RAN (Retd)\n\nCurrently 20 member organisations provide State-level representation. Each has one vote but may nominate up to two representatives.\n\n**They comprise a broad cross-section of the community:**\n\n- Pastoral — the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Uniting Churches.\n- Civic — The Brisbane City Council, the Queensland Department of Education and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n- Civil — The Royal United Services Institute of Queensland Incorporated, Toc H Australia Northern Region Incorporated and the Queensland Country Women’s Association.\n- Welfare — Defence Force Welfare Association, Salvation Army Red Shield Defence Services, and Australia War Widows (Queensland) Incorporated.\n- Service — Defence Joint Operations Support Services.\n- Ex-Service — The Council of Ex-Servicewomen’s Association, the Naval Association of Australia Incorporated, the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia Incorporated, the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans’ Association Incorporated and the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia Incorporated.\n\nQueensland’s unique ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has been a proudly non-aligned citizens’ organisation since its inception in 1916.\n\n\nIt is a most successfully-managed and effective business which has survived because it is keeping abreast of modern business practices and capitalising on society’s patriotic resurgence.\n\nThe ADCC must endure because it will always represent the citizens’ gift of the people to Queensland’s war veterans.\n\nYou can also find out about the ADCC Logo, our Annual Badge Appeal or read a short history of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee.",

      "Content": "The following has been adapted from the book ‘Don't forget me, cobber!’ by Matt Anderson\n\nPlease note that all Australian schools received a copy of ‘Don’t forget me, cobber!’ as part of the 1997 Their Service - Our Heritage ANZAC kit. All Queensland schools were sent additional free copies of this book as part of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland's 1998 ANZAC Education Pack.\n\nThe Western Front was the name the Germans gave to a series of trenches that ran 700 kilometres from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. To imagine this, think of a ditch deep enough to stand in zigzagging its way alongside the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Canberra. As at Gallipoli, machine-gun fire caused terrible casualties on the Western Front. Both sides had dug trenches, sometimes only metres apart, as their only protection from the murderous gun fire. But they were never safe from the explosive artillery shells that rained down on the front line soldiers every few seconds for days at a time. The British High Command needed troops urgently. So after the Gallipoli veterans were rested in Egypt, and had been strengthened by the ‘fair dinkums’ from Australia, they were sent to France to fight Germany. But Gallipoli was not the last time the ANZACs fought the Turks. The Light Horsemen were sent to the Middle East where they took part in several battles, the most spectacular of which was the mounted charge at Beersheeba.\n\nNOTE This symbol means that a detailed map is available. The maps have been prepared as Adobe Acrobat™ files, each ~200kb, and designed to print on two A4 pages.  \n\n## Life in the trenches\n\nWhen the ANZACs arrived at the Western Front, the first thing they saw were the lines of wounded soldiers being taken to the rear. As they got closer, they could feel the earth shake, and hear the constant “crump crump” of artillery shells. The sound was loud enough to make their ears ring, and became their companion for the next three years.",
