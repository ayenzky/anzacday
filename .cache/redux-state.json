          "content": "by **Lyn Marsh**\n\nThis article and images have been reproduced from the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee publication, ANZAC Day 2004.\n\nThe drive from Istanbul to Gelibolu (Gallipoli) in the early morning light was not overly impressive -- miles of sprawling, half-finished apartment blocks and depressing housing estates. There is no attempt to vary the style, no gardens, parks or street planting. Where children run and play, I have no idea. Finally, it all opened up to fields of sunflowers and expanses of water -- the long-imagined Dardanelles.\n\nI was so pleased at this point not to be here with the thousands who arrive for ANZAC Day. There is a poignancy about the place which needs to be quietly absorbed; the wind blowing through the pines; the silence broken only by the sound of birds; monuments to ANZACs and Turks at ANZAC Cove, Lone Pine, the Nek, Chunuk Bair and all the other sites where courageous men gave their lives.\n\n![Beach Cemetery near ANZAC Cove](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543398022/o7vp5tkttv93hvurlurx.png)\n\n**Beach Cemetery, near ANZAC Cove. The peak on the skyline is the feature known to all original ANZACs as The Sphinx. Photograph courtesy Mary Long.**\n\nIt was an enormous privilege to have as our guide Ali Efes, a historian, University lecturer, and retired Turkish naval officer, who grew up in a nearby village, and explored throughout his childhood the battlefields where his grandfather had given his life fighting the ANZACs.\n\nHe presented each of us with a little box containing a couple of worn worry beads, parts of his collection of relics from the dirt amongst the trenches. Rolling those between my fingers as I walked around, my heart went out to the men of both sides who had faced each other, at times not six metres apart.\n\n![ANZAC Cove](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543398044/pz3c4z7i59yf0fgijfir.png)\n\n**ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli, with The Sphinx prominent on the skyline. Photograph courtesy Mary Long. **\n\nAli’s detailed history lesson was fascinating, and even more impressive to hear it from a Turkish man who has made it his life’s work. I learned more in those six hours with him than I have ever absorbed from reading history books. I heard of the extraordinary respect the Turks held for the ANZACs, and understood why we, as Australians, had been welcomed so warmly since our arrival in this country. Together, we gazed out to the sea where so many Allied troops had perished; ordered overboard where, out of their depth and weighed down with 44kg packs, guns and heavy woollen uniforms, they perished before their feet ever touched Turkish soil. Turning, I looked up at the impossible cliffs of the Sphinx, disbelieving that anyone could have scaled those heights laden as they were, let alone under enemy fire.\n\nAli took us through trenches of both sides; where men threw messages across to each other; where the Australians tossed cigarette papers for the Turks to roll their own tobacco, and the Turks reciprocated, throwing tomatoes and fresh fruit to the ANZACs who were struggling on scant rations and limited water brought all the way from Egypt.\n\nThe tales abound of a spirit of camaraderie developing between the opposing forces; to the extent that eventually the men in the trenches deliberately aimed over the heads of their enemy, much to the frustration and ire of their superior officers. Romantic notions perhaps, but history books are full of ‘facts’, so what harm is there in believing a gentler story? Great respect was shown between ordinary men who found themselves the pawns of politicians, playing out the never-ending game of war.\n\n![The monument](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543398074/iefpo0n5q78fy8fis8g6.png)\n\n**The monument, in one of the Turkish cemeteries at Gallipoli, to which Lyn refers in her story. Photograph courtesy Mary Long. **\n\nThe tour of Gallipoli was not yet over. We stopped at a Turkish cemetery, where stood a tall bronze figure of an old Turkish veteran, his granddaughter at his side. It is a tradition of local women to pick flowers and sprigs of Rosemary from the garden at the base of the statue to place into the hands of the child. Ali asked if any of us would like to do the same as a mark of respect. I stepped forward immediately, recognising that the younger women present were hesitating. I tucked the sweet-smelling offering into the hands of the little girl, and as I stepped back, Ali took my own hands, and looking into my eyes proffered a small gift from him and his wife as thanks for my gesture.\n\nI choked back tears as I opened my palm and saw a key ring made from a spent bullet from the battlefield. You see, I am a war widow. My late husband had fought in Vietnam, and when we first met he had given me a similar key ring, with a bullet from that war.\n\nWhat incredible irony -- here, within another generation, we share gifts and embrace our grandfather’s enemy! Now I have been given similar relics of two wars, on different continents. That the bullets, which may well have ended lives two worlds apart, become as mundane as key rings, screams to me the futility of war.\n\n### Will we never learn?\n\n![The famous and evocative monument at ANZAC Cove inscribed](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543398098/timbuqdcojcqzmqbjzvc.png)\n\n*The famous and evocative monument at ANZAC Cove inscribed:*<br>\n*Those heroes that shed their blood *<br>\n*and lost their lives… *<br>\n*You are now living in the soil of a friendly country. *<br>\n*Therefore rest in peace. *<br>\n*There is no difference between the Johnnies*<br>\n* and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side*<br> \n*here in this country of ours… *<br>\n*You, the mothers, *<br>\n*who sent their sons from faraway countries *<br>\n*wipe away your tears; *<br>\n*your sons are now lying in our bosom *<br>\n*and are in peace, *<br>\n*after having lost their lives on this land they have *<br>\n*become our sons as well.*<br>\n*Ataturk, 1934*<br>\n*Photograph courtesy Kevin Long. *\n\nThe following was written by the Athenian statesman, Pericles (c. 495–429 BC), more than two thousand years ago; eons before the first ANZAC Day but only a stone’s throw from Gallipoli.\n\nEach has won a glorious grave -- not that sepulchre of earth wherein they lie, but the living tomb of everlasting remembrance wherein their glory is enshrined. For the whole earth is the sepulchre of heroes. Monuments may rise and tablets be set up to them in their own land, but on far-off shores there is an abiding memorial that no pen or chisel has traced; it is graven not on stone or brass, but on the living hearts of humanity. Take these men for your example. Like them, remember that prosperity can be only for the free, that freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it.",

          "title": "The Spirit of ANZAC",
          "content": "© **Arthur Burke OAM**\n\nThe Spirit of ANZAC was suggested by official war historian C.E.W. Bean to have \"stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never own defeat.\"\n\nThe Spirit was epitomised in the deeds of Simpson with his donkey at Gallipoli - comradeship, courage and sacrifice: others before self. It also encompasses the laughter, the pride and the love of life that is in every Australian. To really understand this Spirit one must delve back into our country's past.\n\nAustralia is a huge land. In the early days, settlements were scarce and far apart yet pioneers built our society's foundations in these fragmented tiny communities. The sun and the open land, the independence and the freedom of living under these conditions was a flame in the blood of our pioneers, a flame that burns whenever men are free, wherever there is a spirit which is willing to help those in need.\n\nIf there were rumours of trouble, immediately someone would saddle a horse and ride off to see if they could help. Though on a comparatively smaller scale, our New Zealand neighbours in this antipodean part of the British Empire also emerged with a very similar culture.\n\nConflicts were not unknown to this part of the world. The Eureka Stockade troubles of 1854 in Victoria, the shearers' strike of 1890 in Queensland and the subsequent eastern seaboard maritime strikes were but a few home grown examples. New Zealand's Maori wars in the early 1860s saw volunteers from the separate colonies of Australia assisting their Kiwi mates to establish independence in another developing country.\n\nAgain in 1885 the colonies displayed passionate outrage and a willingness to avenge the brutal death of Britain's General Gordon at Khartoum, despite only a New South Wales contingent being accepted for service. And when the Boer War erupted in South Africa, volunteer units from the colonies competed for a place beside the Mother Country's warriors.\n\nThus, although the disparate colonies of our great land did not federate till 1901, Australians and New Zealanders had been united since the beginnings of their countries and this unity, this love of life had formed the basis of the Spirit of ANZAC.\n\n\"The Mother Country's in a spot of bother again,\" was a typical observation when the Great War began in 1914. \"Might as well help her get this sorted out,\" was the accustomed response to someone in need. For a century the antipodean survivors had been helping overcome Nature's curses and supporting each other's causes. Now they were equally ready again to assist Britain, this time to overcome German militarism.\n\nThis was the Spirit which imbued the volunteers as they dashed off with seemingly gay abandon to the First World War and what was to become the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.\n\nThese bold, laughing soldiers were a new, unknown factor of a very old Empire. \"They seemed to be of one race, for all of them had something the same bearing, and something the same look of humorous, swift decision\" described Poet Laureate John Masefield. But if the British thought they \"took a bit of getting used to\", the enemy never got used to them. These \"colonials\" fought as they lived - bravely, openly, independently, and without fear. They proved that their young countries could produce men equal to any in the world, perhaps the greatest fighting force this world has known - the \"ANZACs\".\n\nOn 25 April 1915 a new world was born. A new side of man's character was revealed. The Spirit of ANZAC was kindled. It flared with a previously unknown, almost superhuman strength. There was a determination, a zest, a drive which swept up from the beaches on Gallipoli Peninsula as the ANZACs thrust forward with their torch of freedom.\n\nAs they fell, they threw those following the torch so their quest would maintain its momentum. That Torch of Freedom has continually been thrown from falling hands, has kindled in the catchers' souls a zeal and desire for both our individual liberty and our countries' liberty. That desire has been handed down with the memory and burns as brightly as the flame which first kindled it.\n\nBut the Spirit of ANZAC is not confined to the battlefield. It lives in the schools, on the sports fields, in fact all over these great countries of Australia and New Zealand. The sun invades our bodies and makes us 'mad'; mad for freedom - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom to live and think as you will.\n\nThe Spirit of ANZAC is not something we can see but a powerful driving sensation that can only be felt. It is a feeling that burns in the heart of every Australian and New Zealand countryman. A warm, tender, fiery, even melancholy ideal that nurtures intense patriotism in the innermost soul of every body.\n\nMany foundation ANZACs died, but their glorious challenge to catch the thrown torch shouts loud and strong to all. Their goal was freedom for the land they loved.\n\nThe Spirit of ANZAC is invincible. It is the flame that burns forevermore in the heart of every true Australian and New Zealander.\n\nToday we stand safe and free, clothed with all the privileges and rights of citizens in these great free countries. And all these things - liberty, security, opportunity, the privileges of citizenship - we owe to those men who fought, endured, suffered, and died for us and for their country. Their deeds and their sacrifices gave us the invincible, the intangible, the Spirit of ANZAC.\n\n- Colonel Arthur Burke OAM (Retd.) is Past Honorary President of the Executive Committee of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee (Queensland) Incorporated. He was inspired to write this article after reading a collection of essays written in 1961 by the students of St Margaret’s Anglican Girls’ School, Ascot, Brisbane, following their attendance at the school's annual ANZAC Day Service which included an an address on “*ANZAC and its Significance, Emphasising the Spirit of ANZAC*”. The article is an amalgam of ideas from several essays and the author's own thoughts.",

Unlike today, most Australians felt they were more British than Australian. Because of this loyalty, the man who was to become Australia’s next Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, promised that *“Australia will stand by to defend (Great Britain) to our last man and our last shilling”*.\n\n[Men rushed to join the long queues at army barracks around Australia](/volunteer). All had different reasons for wanting to enlist. Many believed they had no choice but to protect England from invasion. Others thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel. And many just didn’t want to miss out on something so exciting. “*Don’t worry,*” they told their mothers, wives and girlfriends. “*It will all be over by Christmas.*” The first ships that took the soldiers off to war were filled to overflowing. Many of the men were from the country and some had never seen the ocean before. But they soon became used to it, as they spent many weeks at sea. When they finally reached land, many were disappointed they were not in England. The Generals had decided there were already too many soldiers in the British training camps, so the Australians were sent to Egypt, where they finished their training.\n\nThe Generals had also decided that these soldiers needed a name. They were to be known as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, or ANZACs.\n\nTurkey (then called the Ottoman Empire) was on the side of Germany in the First World War. The British Generals decided they could defeat Turkey if they could capture the capital city called Istanbul (then called Constantinople).\n\nAfter the Turks sank several British and French ships in the Dardanelles, it was decided that the only way to capture Constantinople would be to land soldiers near a place called Gallipoli. The closest soldiers were the ANZACs, who had completed their training in Egypt. The Australians were getting restless, and after coming all this way they wanted to see how good they were in battle. They were soon to get their chance.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543827851/gxpugavas01eyxnphyvj.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

          "content": "In April 1915, at a little-known beach in Turkey named Gallipoli, two legends were created. The first was the courage of the Australian soldier: the second was the wartime service of the Salvation Army.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543829326/bpjojtis1y6zmm7eceyd.png)\n\n**AWM P00329.001. Portrait of Chaplain Major William McKenzie, MC, of the Salvation Army, who was attached to the 4th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, during the 1914-18 War.**\n\nIt was in the First World War that the image of the Salvation Army chaplain, tending to the physical and spiritual needs of the Diggers wherever they were, was truly forged. The Salvation Army was already becoming widely identified as 'Christianity with its sleeves rolled up', and men like 'Fighting Mac' McKenzie typified that image.\nAs chaplain to the 1st Infantry Brigade, Fighting Mac went ashore with the troops at Gallipoli. He saw horrors no man should see. He accepted responsibility with which no man should be burdened. In one three-day period, Fighting Mac conducted 647 funeral services. He was constantly in the front line -- after one funeral service he found three bullet holes in his hat. A grateful government awarded him the Military Cross for his work, a gallantry honour virtually unheard of for a military chaplain.\n\nThe Salvation Army did its work in every theatre of that terrible conflict. At Le Havre, in France, the famous 'HOP IN' sign made its first appearance. These were centres where the ordinary soldier could get a cup of tea and a bit of advice or encouragement if he needed it.\n\nSalvation Army chaplains and workers gave without restraint or condition. They would hold religious services, pray with the soldiers, and counsel them. Without criticism or condemnation, they would also do their best to keep them out of bars, brothels and gambling halls.\n\nThe Salvation Army women did their part too. Dozens of nurses from Salvation Army homes such as Bethesda volunteered, and gave distinguished service in the Australian Army Nursing Service.\n\nBy the last year of the war, the Salvation Army was operating nearly five hundred hostels or rest centres, with more than eight hundred officers in the field. They had served in places as far-flung as Egypt, France, Belgium, India, Palestine and, of course, Gallipoli.\n\nTheir work did not go unnoticed at the highest level. When the terrible conflict was finally over, King George V personally dictated a letter to General Bramwell Booth in which he said:\n\nBy its work of love and mercy, in both peace and war, the Salvation Army has become honoured and endeared in the hearts of the nations of the world.\n\nBut it had achieved more than just praise from high places. The Salvation Army had won itself a place in the hearts of thousands of ordinary soldiers who had gratefully received help and comfort in their darkest hour.\n\nNo longer would Salvationists be pelted with rotten tomatoes at their public meetings. Gallipoli may have re-created Australia as a nation -- it had also re-created the Salvation Army in the minds of millions of Australians.\n\nAustralia emerged from the Great War with a new sense of identity, and with the knowledge that the world had changed forever. The soldiers of the cross who gave such gallant service in time of war were now equally accepted in time of peace as well.\n\nThe war to end all wars, the Great War of 1914–1918, did not end war -- it merely laid the foundation for a greater conflict. Ground down by the oppressive terms of the Treaty of Versailles and racked by depression, Germany welcomed the promises of the Nazi Party -- order, a better standard of living, work for all, and room for a recovering nation to grow.\n\nUnfortunately, that room to grow was at the expense of others.\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On 3 September, Poland's allies, Britain and France, declared war on Germany. On the same day, Australia's Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, told the Australian people that as a consequence of Britain's action, they too were at war with Germany.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543829354/blxvfthzi2uzp39cvyol.png)\n\n**AWM 027747. Northern Territory, 1942. The Salvation Army had several vehicles fitted out for supplying cool drinks to troops in camp and on marches.**\n\nThe Salvation Army went to work at home and on the battlefield. Home comforts, advice, support, and spiritual assistance were offered and gladly given to all those who asked for them. Salvation Army huts and canteens were set up wherever there was a need for them -- in training camps in Australia, in the deserts of North Africa, in the jungles of New Guinea. Wherever an Australian soldier, sailor or airman served, so did the Salvation Army.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543829393/hi3jh1dikarfbnbpxpxz.png)\n\n**AWM 027002.

Tobruk, 1941. A group of Salvation Army and AIF personnel outside the Salvation Army hut.**\n\nOne of the turning points of the early war years was the siege of Tobruk, and one of the most loved men present at that conflict was the Salvation Army chaplain to the 2/9th Battalion, Arthur McIlveen -- known to all and sundry as 'Padre Mac'. Padre Mac's secret weapon was an ancient wind up gramophone. He possessed only a few records. Unfortunately several were literally blown to bits by shellfire. Padre Mac taped them together on the B-side with sticking plaster and reckoned they were still worth hearing, despite an understandable reduction in sound quality.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543829487/px6g0xuylsl8h2rli8yk.png)\n\n**AWM 007478.

At the Salvos own request, the Red Shield post was stationed where it was most needed, close behind the shifting front line.\nAt Milne Bay, there were no less than fourteen Red Shield centres. At Wau, the Salvos were right in the thick of things -- eight of them were wounded when the Japanese forced a retreat after twelve days of some of the hardest fighting of the entire Pacific War.\n\nThe Second World War officially came to an end on 15 August 1945. More than twenty million people died during those six terrible years. The Salvation Army's work in this monumental conflict created its own lasting heritage. The memory of the Salvationists' selfless service would stay with an entire generation of Australians for the rest of their lives. But for the Salvationists themselves, their efforts were little enough compared with the sacrifices of the men and women who had answered their country's call in those darkest days.\n\nSource: The Salvation Army, 1900–2000, A Century of Care\n\nEditor’s Note: The Salvation Army’s soldiers of the cross have continued to offer spiritual comfort, advice and support to members of the Australian Defence Force in later conflicts and peacekeeping/peacemaking operations including Korea, Vietnam, Somalia and EastTimor.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543829538/efz6qhoarfdprblog1bw.png)\n\n**AWM DNE/65/0074/VN.

          "content": "The Australians spent two winters in the trenches on the Western Front, 1916-1917 and 1917-1918. Each seemed an eternity. Unaccustomed to the iciness and length of Continental winters the men suffered terribly. During the winter of 1916-17 more than 20,000 Australians were evacuated with exhaustion, frostbite or trench feet.\n\nSergeant R.A. McInnes, after a night on a shelf cut into the side of a trench, wrote, “When I woke I was terribly cold. My feet protruded from my overcoat and the caked mud on my big legging-boots were covered with white frost.”\n\nCorporal A.G. Thomas wrote, “God, I cannot describe the horrors of last night. We just fell down and slept, rain and all, and shells falling all about us but we were too exhausted to bother, we didn’t mind if we were killed, it was terrible.”\n\nAfter fitful sleep, men awoke before dawn to find their eyelids frozen shut and even their lips stuck together. Frozen ground was preferable to the mud but some men broke limbs when they slipped on the icy surfaces. Shells were more dangerous exploding on hard ground than in mud.\n\nThe Germans had deeper, warmer dugouts but they too suffered in the winter and on many occasions Australians and Germans climbed onto their respective parapets where they stamped about and exercised to warm their frozen bodies. Each side solved the problem of orders to “be aggressive” by ignoring each other.\n\nEven in the relative comfort of billets life was hard. Ungloved hands were numb in a few seconds, boots need warming before being put on, bread could not be cut with a knife and boiling tea being rushed from the cookhouse froze within 20 paces.\n\nIn the trenches, the cold was so demoralising that rational thought was no longer possible and Australians prayed to be wounded, the only honourable escape from the torture of winter. Some exposed themselves to shellfire, risking death in the hope of a wound, which in any case could lead to dreadful privations before they reached hospital.\n\n“Australian boys shouldn’t be expected to live like this,” a soldier wrote home in early 1917.",

Their first major use of gas occurred on 22 April 1915 when they released chlorine from pressure cylinders in the Ypres Salient. The clouds of greenish vapour took the British and French by surprise.\n\nChoking and vomiting, many British and French troops fled in panic, leaving a five-kilometre gap in the defences. The Germans, unaware of their success, failed to exploit it. Soldiers were advised to hold a cloth soaked in urine over their mouth and nose; the ammonia in the urine neutralised the chlorine.\n\nAustralians at ANZAC were given pads impregnated with bicarbonate of soda to be tied over the mouth and nose. While still at ANZAC they were issued with hoods impregnated with hyposulphate of soda, but they were never necessary. The hypohelmets, as the Australians called them, were useless against phosgene mixed with chlorine, which the Germans used at the end of 1915.\n\nSoon after the AIF reached France in spring 1916 they were issued with a box respirator which filtered the gases. Worn on the chest, it was connected to the face piece by a rubber tube. Separate goggles protected the eyes against tear gas. A respirator developed at Melbourne University early in 1915 influenced the development of the effective box respirator which all British and Empire troops had by 1917.\n\nThe British caught up with German development and from 1916 both sides increasingly used gas-filled shells, fired from guns, mortars and spring-loaded projectors. In mid-1917 the Germans fired mustard gas, dichlorethyl sulphate, known as yellow cross because the shells were so marked. More like an oil and odourless, it took Allied troops by surprise, especially as its worst effects, severe skin blistering and serious lung congestion, did not appear for several hours. Mustard gas remained potent for weeks in mud and heavy soil.\n\nBy March 1918, before any attack, the Germans fired mustard gas on the flanks of the area selected for attack, to block support, and a less lethal, low-persistency gas on the front, so that the German attackers themselves would not be badly affected.\n\nThey often masked a mustard gas attack with high-explosive shells as well as sneezing gas - chemically diphenyl chlorarsine, or blue cross in soldiers’ talk - which made it difficult to keep the respirators on. The Australians had to wear masks throughout a bombardment and few could sleep with them on.\n\nThe Germans drenched back areas with mustard gas and Australian casualties were sometimes heavy. For instance, after heavy gassing the 4th Division’s artillery was withdrawn on 25 October 1917. In October and November that year 1,313 gunners became casualties and 20 of them quickly died.\n\nThousands of Australians were affected by gas and about 200 died from it - a small number considering the overall casualties. Mustard gas caused the majority of gas cases. It stripped the mucous membrane from the bronchial tubes and caused pain beyond endurance. Most sufferers had to be strapped to their beds and death took up to five weeks. Chlorine, phosgene and chloropicrin damaged the respiratory organs. Each gas had its ghastly effects. Severe chlorine gassing led to slow death by asphyxiation. The Diggers said that chlorine smelt like a mixture of pineapple and pepper, phosgene like rotten fish.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, neither the AIF’s best known expert in anti-gas procedures, Captain A.L. Rossiter, Gas Officer of the 4th Division, nor anybody else found a protection against mustard gas which fell on the soldier’s skin.",

There was the added spur of mockery, overt or implied-a child asking, “What did you do in the War, Daddy?”; a strong-featured woman asking her man, “Will you go or must I?” By 1915 the art of poster propaganda was very well developed and worldwide, and outside the pornography of painted violence the themes were much the same whatever the nation. “Our” men were always firm-jawed and heroic, “Theirs” were fiercely evil and generally unshaven. The summarily pointing or beckoning finger was a universal symbol.\n\nPerhaps it was because the battlefields of Europe were so distant, perhaps because the lure of England as “Home” was so strong that there entered into the early phase of recruitment in Australia an element of huckstering. It was as though a cheapjack travel agent was at work to persuade young men to seize their chance. The long casualty lists from the Dardanelles and the disasters of France and Flanders were yet to come; in the days before the end at Gallipoli, there was a fairground atmosphere about the urging to join for The Greatest Show on Earth.\n\nTo some extent it was true. It was exciting. The bands filling the streets with colour and cadence, the sense of swagger about the men already in uniform all laid the groundwork for a widespread and very successful advertising campaign, certainly the best of its time. The campaign’s theme was elemental and almost irresistible; the product offered free travel, excitement and a spice of danger and implied a just and rightful victory and the rewards that would follow. To ignore such a campaign could mean ostracism; to accept the challenge was to snatch at the chance of a lifetime.",

Apart from the staggering £274 million (approximately A$19,000 million in 1998) raised by seven government war loan campaigns, a vast array of privately run patriotic funds and charities bombarded the public with appeals to dig deep into their pockets.\n\nThe Australian branch of the British Red Cross Society, and the nationwide Australian Comforts Fund grew into huge fund-raising bureaucracies staffed by an unpaid army of women administrators and workers. At the regional and local level countless women’s charity groups sprung up in keen rivalry to help the cause. These private bodies filled an important gap by providing the troops with warm clothing and comforts packages, by supervising the care and rehabilitation of returned soldiers and by raising relief funds for civilian wartime victims in Allied Europe.\n\nOver £13 million (approximately A$900 million in 1998) was raised during the war years by these funds from bazaars, street fairs and processions, costume balls, garden parties, dances and public meetings. When the streets weren’t filled with parades, one could still be accosted by cake sellers, button sellers and door-to-door collectors. The Red Cross even commissioned commercial films, to raise funds through box office profits.\n\nThe war-loan subscribers and charity donors came predominantly from the middle and upper classes for they had the capacity to “give” generously. Working class families on the other hand were often unfairly accused of disloyalty for failing to do their share for the home-front war effort, particularly when the community was divided over the conscription issue and union strikes. They had borne the brunt of war casualties and were understandably resentful.\n\nAs the public purse was squeezed for more funds the Australian people learned that running a war was indeed a costly business.\n\n© Time-Life Australia Pty Ltd 1998<br>\n(from the series Australians at War)",

          "content": "**Name**:   Jacka, Albert<br>\n**Rank**:\t    Lance Corporal<br>\n**Unit**:\t    14th Battalion, 4th Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division<br>\n**Date**:\t    19-20 May 1915<br>\n**Place**:     Courtney's Post, Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey\n\nALBERT JACKA was born on 10 January 1893 at Winchelsea, Victoria, one of seven children of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Jacka. His family moved to Wedderburn when he was five and he went to school there and obtained his standard and merit certificates. His father worked in the timber industry, first supplying sleepers to the Victorian Railways, and later timber to the mines in Bendigo. On leaving school Albert went to work for his father and for a short time was an engine-cleaner at Bendigo. At the age of eighteen he obtained employment with the Victorian State Forests Department and was subsequently stationed at Wedderburn, Cohuna, Koondrook, Lake Charm and Heathcote.\n\nJacka enlisted in the AIF at Heathcote on 8 September 1914 but as his papers were lost he had to do so again in Melbourne ten days later. His unit embarked on 22 December and spent two months training before landing at ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli, on 26 April 1915.\n\nOn 19 May, the Turks launched a general attack to push the Australians into the sea. They seized ten metres of trench at Courtney’s Post, but Australians at either end stopped them from continuing to advance. At the northern end Jacka, with several others, tried to evict the Turks, but was beaten back. It was then decided that while a feint was made from the same end, Jacka would attack from the rear. The party waited long enough for Jacka to circle to the rear and then threw two bombs and gave covering fire. Jacka leapt over the parapet, shot five Turks with his rifle, bayoneted two others and forced the rest to flee the captured trench. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action and received it from King George V at Windsor Castle on 29 September 1916. It was the first Victoria Cross to be awarded to the AIF in the 1914-18 war.\n\nJacka was appointed lance corporal on 27 August 1915, the following day was promoted to corporal, and on 12 September to sergeant. On 14 November he became a company sergeant major and second lieutenant on 29 April 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant on 18 August and his final promotion, to captain, came on 15 March 1917.\n\nAt Pozieres, on 7 August 1916, the Germans overran a portion of the line which included Jacka’s dug-out. He charged a large number of enemy who were rounding up prisoners and a furious close quarter fight ensued in which he was wounded three times, once through the neck. Inspired by Jacka, the captured men turned on their captors: many Germans were taken prisoner and the line was retaken. For his actions Jacka received the Military Cross. C.E.W. Bean wrote of this day that Jacka’s counter-attack ‘stands as the most dramatic and effective act of individual audacity in the history of the AIF’. At Bullecourt, on 8 April 1917, when the 4th Division was preparing to attack the Hindenburg line, Jacka, then intelligence officer of the 14th, made a dangerous night reconnaissance of the wire in front of the objective. He got through the wire in two places, brought back a report, and then went out to lay tapes on the assault line. As he was doing so, two Germans approached. He attempted to fire his revolver as they came at him, but nothing happened. Jacka rushed them, seizing the officer first, and eventually brought both in as prisoners. The attacking Australian troops then assembled unseen on the tapes and Jacka’s action undoubtedly saved them from bombardment and heavy fire. For this he received a bar to the Military Cross. There has been speculation as to whether Jacka merited two bars to his Victoria Cross. C.E.W. Bean wrote: ‘Everyone who knows the facts, knows that Jacka earned the Victoria Cross three times’.\n\nOn other occasions Jacka exhibited considerable military skill. At Messines he made a valuable reconnaissance and led his company in taking 800 metres of territory and capturing a field gun. At Polygon Wood, just after Jacka had returned from Britain where he was sent to recover from a wound he had received in July 1917, he was virtually responsible for controlling the 14th, which had for some time been known as ‘Jacka’s Mob’.\n\nAt the end of May 1918 Jacka was badly gassed and a missile passed through his trachea. He was evacuated to No. 20 Casualty Clearing Station at Vignacourt and it was thought for a time that he would not recover. When he did he was sent to Britain for two operations and a long recuperative period. He returned to Australia on 6 September 1919 and his AIF appointment ended on 10 January 1920 when he returned to Melbourne to a hero’s welcome.\n\nJacka entered business with two former members of the 14th Battalion and helped establish a merchant and importing firm, but the business collapsed during the depression. He married Veronica Carey in 1929, and was elected to the St Kilda Council. He later became mayor, and displayed great concern for the welfare of the unemployed in his municipality.\n\nHis war wounds, business pressures and the worries of office all contributed to his breakdown in health. On 18 December 1931 he entered Caulfield Repatriation Hospital and a month later, on 17 January 1932, died of chronic nephritis. He was buried with full military honours in St Kilda cemetery on the 19th. He had eight Victoria Cross winners as pallbearers. A memorial stone, with a bas-relief portrait of Jacka by sculptor Wallace Anderson, was erected over his grave on 15 May and a house was purchased for his widow from public subscription.\n\nHe was survived by his wife and his adopted daughter, Betty, and predeceased his parents.\n\nHis name is commemorated on a plaque at the Victorian Garden of Remembrance, Springvale war cemetery, and by a number of streets in Melbourne and Canberra. In 1982 the St Kilda City Council renamed parts of the busy Lower Esplanade and Marine Parade as Jacka Boulevard. For many years the 14th Battalion commemorated the anniversary of his death with a memorial service at his grave and this is being continued by the St Kilda Council and the St Kilda Historical Society. A portrait by George Coates is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.\n\n**© AWM publication They Dared Mightily**",

Most of these weapons were manufactured in Britain, although a small arms factory in Lithgow, New South Wales, also supplied Australian troops embarking for France with the same rifle.\n\nApart from his Lee-Enfield slung over his shoulder, all the kit a soldier needed for the battlefield was fitted into pouches or hooks on a complex webbing harness that he buckled over his jacket. An entrenching tool, consisting of a wooden handle and detachable iron head (pick-shaped at one end and shovel-shaped at the other), hung from his belt. Field compass, map case, dixie can, mess utensils, water bottle, pocket watch and field dressing were either slotted into pouches or tied to the harness, and were all standard British Army issue. Box respirator gas masks, which had superseded the more primitive cloth-hood type by mid-1916, were stored in a small haversack hung round the neck at chest level.\n\nThis basic survival kit was supplemented in various ways. A family farewell gift often consisted of a practical item like a mesh-covered wristwatch or a brand new pistol. A grisly repertoire of weapons for hand-to-hand fighting - knives, daggers and trench clubs - was either purchased from locals or other Allied soldiers, or confiscated from enemy prisoners. Luger pistols were popular with the officers.\n\nOrganisations such as the YMCA, the ACF and the Red Cross sent the troops ‘comfort packages’. They included writing wallets with paper and pencils; toiletries such as soap, razor blades, combs and shiny, unbreakable metal mirrors; sewing kits, called ‘Hussifs’; and enameled tins containing candles and matches.\n\n© Time-Life Australia Pty Ltd 1998 <br>\n(from the series Australians at War)",

          "content": "Australian soldiers wrote openly in their letters home about the horrors of warfare, and the tone of letters and postcards dramatically indicated the Diggers’ changing attitudes to their predicament. Early letters were characterised by a spirit of bravado. Lieutenant H.P. Malpas wrote to his family in June 1916: “At last the day is near when Australia’s boys will once again be given an opportunity to show the world what we are made of. Today you should have seen the look of determination on the faces of all. I am sure the Hun will be sorry for the day when Australia sent her sons to France.”\n\nThe bloody fighting soon began to dampen this enthusiasm and letter writers became increasingly frank about their fears. Major W.G.M Claridge admitted, “I am not going to tell a lie and say I wasn’t afraid, because I was. And who wouldn’t be, with Death grinning at you from all around and hellish 5.9 shells shrieking through the air. I don’t know how I stood it so long without breaking.” Words such as “hellish”, “massacre” and “suicidal” recurred in these letters, each soldier having his own story of personal terror and narrow escape.\n\nWith characteristic honesty, many Australians anticipated death in forthcoming “stunts” with a brave farewell to their loved ones. Lieutenant W. H. Crowle knew he was dying from his wounds when he wrote to his wife and young son: “You must be prepared for the worst to happen any day. It is no use trying to hide things. I am in terrible agony. I was hit running out to see the other officer who was with me, but badly wounded. I was in the thick of the attack at Pozieres, and had just about done my duty. I am very sorry, dear, but still you will be well provided for, for I am easy on that score, so cheer up, dear.”\n\nThough initially eager to see the Mother Country and to serve her cause in France, disillusionment was expressed in letters in a nostalgic home-sickness for Australia. One soldier pined, “I hardly realised what a great country Australia is until I left it.” With sprigs of wattle or gum preserved in their wallets or notebooks, the Diggers would have heartily agreed with one soldier’s half-joking reply to an English lady’s query, “How often do you get to leave Australia, my man?” He answered, “Once every war.”\n\n© Time-Life Australia Pty Ltd 1998 <br>\n(from the series Australians at War)",

Most distinctive was the Digger’s uniform. The workmanlike woollen khaki jacket, cut loose-necked and baggy, and detailed with blackened metal buttons, topped sturdy, lace-up, ankle-length boots made entirely of leather and hobnailed for extra grip.\n\nPuttees were long strips of woollen material bound round the lower leg from ankle to knee and were intended to stop water and mud sloshing into boots and breeches. They were cursed by soldiers as worse than useless; they cut off circulation when too tight because they shrank in the wet, and unwound when too loose, hampering movement.\n\nThe rabbit fur-felt slouch hat with its Rising Sun badge became the readily identifiable symbol of Australian soldiery, and when the AIF arrived in France their hats were reluctantly swapped for British steel helmets.\n\nIn France the Australian soldier was also issued with a wet-weather “gas” cape as worn by the British. Spare uniform, standard kit and a few personal items were packed for travel in a kit bag, a drawstring, light canvas dufflebag with the soldier’s name and number stencilled on the outside.\n\nAs well as carrying identity papers, the Australian soldiers wore two engraved oval ID discs, called “dead meat tickets”, on necklets. It was the unenviable job of the Graves Registration Unit to recover these discs from the bodies of the dead to identify those killed in battle.\n\n© Time-Life Australia Pty Ltd 1998<br> \n(from the series Australians at War)",

Their first major use of gas occurred on 22 April 1915 when they released chlorine from pressure cylinders in the Ypres Salient. The clouds of greenish vapour took the British and French by surprise.\n\nChoking and vomiting, many British and French troops fled in panic, leaving a five-kilometre gap in the defences. The Germans, unaware of their success, failed to exploit it. Soldiers were advised to hold a cloth soaked in urine over their mouth and nose; the ammonia in the urine neutralised the chlorine.\n\nAustralians at ANZAC were given pads impregnated with bicarbonate of soda to be tied over the mouth and nose. While still at ANZAC they were issued with hoods impregnated with hyposulphate of soda, but they were never necessary. The hypohelmets, as the Australians called them, were useless against phosgene mixed with chlorine, which the Germans used at the end of 1915.\n\nSoon after the AIF reached France in spring 1916 they were issued with a box respirator which filtered the gases. Worn on the chest, it was connected to the face piece by a rubber tube. Separate goggles protected the eyes against tear gas. A respirator developed at Melbourne University early in 1915 influenced the development of the effective box respirator which all British and Empire troops had by 1917.\n\nThe British caught up with German development and from 1916 both sides increasingly used gas-filled shells, fired from guns, mortars and spring-loaded projectors. In mid-1917 the Germans fired mustard gas, dichlorethyl sulphate, known as yellow cross because the shells were so marked. More like an oil and odourless, it took Allied troops by surprise, especially as its worst effects, severe skin blistering and serious lung congestion, did not appear for several hours. Mustard gas remained potent for weeks in mud and heavy soil.\n\nBy March 1918, before any attack, the Germans fired mustard gas on the flanks of the area selected for attack, to block support, and a less lethal, low-persistency gas on the front, so that the German attackers themselves would not be badly affected.\n\nThey often masked a mustard gas attack with high-explosive shells as well as sneezing gas - chemically diphenyl chlorarsine, or blue cross in soldiers’ talk - which made it difficult to keep the respirators on. The Australians had to wear masks throughout a bombardment and few could sleep with them on.\n\nThe Germans drenched back areas with mustard gas and Australian casualties were sometimes heavy. For instance, after heavy gassing the 4th Division’s artillery was withdrawn on 25 October 1917. In October and November that year 1,313 gunners became casualties and 20 of them quickly died.\n\nThousands of Australians were affected by gas and about 200 died from it - a small number considering the overall casualties. Mustard gas caused the majority of gas cases. It stripped the mucous membrane from the bronchial tubes and caused pain beyond endurance. Most sufferers had to be strapped to their beds and death took up to five weeks. Chlorine, phosgene and chloropicrin damaged the respiratory organs. Each gas had its ghastly effects. Severe chlorine gassing led to slow death by asphyxiation. The Diggers said that chlorine smelt like a mixture of pineapple and pepper, phosgene like rotten fish.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, neither the AIF’s best known expert in anti-gas procedures, Captain A.L. Rossiter, Gas Officer of the 4th Division, nor anybody else found a protection against mustard gas which fell on the soldier’s skin.",

(Ogmios Publications PO Box 3100, YERONGA Q 4104; ISBN 0 646 16524 0)\n\nIn his introduction to this book Tom explained how and why he came to write the Simpson story.\n\n“My own personal background bears more than a passing resemblance to that of Simpson himself. I too, was born and bred on Tyneside and raised in a working class home. My father was a shipyard painter. After qualifying as a pharmacist at Edinburgh in 1961, I followed a similar adventurous route to that of Simpson; working my way around England, and then Australia, before enlisting in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps in 1966, for a five year short service commission. In 1969 I commanded the Australian field medical supply unit, in Vietnam.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, however, it wasn’t until after I had returned from Vietnam, and had been posted to a Field Ambulance at Townsville, in 1970, that I first became aware, fully, of Simpson (Simpson was a member of 3 Field Ambulance) and what he’d done.\n\nLike almost everyone else in Australia I had always been vaguely aware of their national military hero - one can scarcely avoid this, with the number of statues honouring ‘The Man with the Donkey’, throughout the land - not to mention the yearly re-enactment of his famous donkey-rides, in the streets of the capital cities, on ANZAC Day.\n\nIt was when I discovered that Simpson was a Geordie, that ‘the penny dropped.’ I realised then - as any other Geordie instantly would have - not only what Simpson had been doing - but why. At the same time, I used to ask some of my fellow officers and soldiers at Townsville - Why, do you imagine, of all those soldiers at ANZAC, should Simpson alone have thought of using a donkey, to carry wounded soldiers down to the hospital on the beach? The answer was invariably, a shake of the head. And in truth I didn’t expect any other. Yet to any Geordie - especially to a Geordie kid, the answer would have been obvious. But then how could one expect anyone outside of this particular culture to understand just what a ‘ride on the donkeys’ - at South Shields, or Whitley Bay, meant to a Geordie kid - this special, magical experience, to be long savoured as part of a treasured day at the seaside, throughout those long, dark, bleak North East winters.\n\nAnd to complete the picture - if any lingering doubt existed - I discovered that Simpson had not only grown up at South Shields, but that as a young lad, he had been - a donkey-boy.\n\nI began searching out all the information that was available on Simpson. And it was here that I made the most amazing discovery. Because there was virtually nothing known, or written about what the man had actually done - or who he was. The Australian war historian, Dr C.E.W. Bean, devoted a total of 27 lines to Simpson, in his mammoth account of ANZAC; and the medical historian, Colonel A.G. Butler DSO, gave Simpson 21 lines in the medical history of ANZAC. It should be noted however, that these official sources give only the flimsiest, and most vague accounts of Simpson’s activities. Additionally, the Reverend Sir Irving Benson wrote a very brief account of Simpson’s life and deeds at ANZAC in his book, The Man with the Donkey, published in 1965. Half of this slim volume is devoted to correspondence between Simpson and his mother and sister. But here again there is very little factual description of what Simpson had actually done.\n\nYet notwithstanding the fact that so little is known about him, this hasn’t stopped Australia from honouring this man as a national hero, in statue and painting, right throughout the land.\n\nThe principal reason for this seems to have been because the ANZACs themselves made Simpson their own personal hero at ANZAC. Even while he was still alive, he had already become a living legend. Every ANZAC who spoke of him, invariably added, that he had won the Victoria Cross a dozen times over. As Simpson’s closest friend, and fellow member of 3 Field Ambulance, L/Cpl. Andy Davidson, Distinguished Conduct Medal, and Military Medal winner, said of him - ‘he was the most respected, and admired of all heroes at ANZAC’. (Australian War Memorial File PR 83/69, 10 of ANZAC 7.) Also, from this same AWM file:\n\nAfter his death the memory of his deeds remained vividly with the men at the front. Lt-Col. S.C. (later Lieut-General, Sir Stanley) Savige, was reported in the Argus, of 2.11.33 as saying - in support of the appeal to erect a monument to Simpson’s memory - that when his battalion, the 24th, went ashore at Gallipoli in September, 1915, one of the first stories newcomers heard, was that of The Man with the Donkey. Simple as the story was, it remained with the troops as an epic of devotion.\n\nBeing a Geordie myself, and thoroughly conversant with Geordie culture until the age of 24, whence I departed England’s shores, I knew that nothing of this story was known on Tyneside.

          "content": "For the Australian troops in the front line, the Australian Comforts Fund coffee stall became a treasured refuge from the misery of the trenches. Chaplain W.E. Dexter established the first stall behind the lines at Pozieres in August 1916 and under the auspices of the ACF many more were set up and staffed by soldiers and clergy. Throughout the bitterly cold nights, in tents, dugouts and hastily assembled huts at the corner of every Australian battlefield, the stalls dispensed mugs of tea, coffee and cocoa to the exhausted troops trudging in and out of the line. According to the ACF’s meticulously recorded statistics, more than 12 million such mugs of coffee and tea were served during the First World War.\n\nThe ACF did not just brew up coffee for the troops. Local women’s groups in Australia sprang up early in the war to provide tobacco, cakes, puddings, condensed milk, sugar,, biscuits newspapers and other ‘luxury’ items to supplement the Australian soldier’s army rations and personal kit. These fund-raising bodies were amalgamated in 1916 to form a national body which undertook to provide ‘comforts’ to all Australians abroad. The ACF grew into an enormous fundraising, collecting, sorting and distribution machine which rivalled the scope of the Red Cross. Although men took some executive positions on national and state committees, the bulk of the administrative and manual work fell on a huge ‘army’ of unpaid women.\n\nA phenomenal 1,354,328 pairs of woollen socks, knitted by volunteers and shipped to Europe by the ACF, represented an estimated 10 million hour’s work. Nearly two million Christmas boxes containing writing wallets, chewing gum, handkerchiefs, tobacco, and sausages were sent to England and France during the war as well as thousands of shirts, vests, pyjamas and kangaroo-skin fleece-lined jackets.\n\nThe ACF was a source of solace and encouragement for the troops abroad; it was also a means for the women at home to contribute to the war effort and identify with their young men in the trenches. The vast amount of organisational work involved in running the ACF developed new managerial skills among the women themselves. They raised thousands of pounds, through door-knock appeals, fetes and button days to cover the costs of materials and shipping.\n\nThe ACF was dissolved at the end of the war, but had proved such a success as a vital link between home and the battlefield that it was revived in 1940 to supply ‘comforts’ for a new generation of Australian soldiers.\n\n**© Time-Life Australia Pty Ltd 1998**<br> \n(from the series Australians at War)",

          "content": "Florence Nightingale would not have felt out of place on Gallipoli. There were dead and wounded from the moment of landing, and the one casualty clearing station that went ashore with 1st ANZAC Corps headquarters on April 25 had a complement of only 63 men. While each unit provided stretcher-bearers and some medical staff, the mounting numbers of unburied dead and of wounded awaiting treatment often became unmanageable, especially after heavy fighting.\n\nWhat mud would do on the Western Front, the fly did on Gallipoli; it became an implacable enemy. The combination of open wounds, heat, dirt, lice, fleas, lack of water, an unsatisfactory diet and fatigue were all compounded by flyborne diseases. There was no chance to bury many of the dead of either side; while strict control of hygiene was imposed wherever possible, latrines were crude; Turkish hygiene was less controlled, and human faeces were added to the food scraps and mule droppings that littered the lines. And when wounded and sick men were evacuated to Mudros (a town on the Greek island of Lemnos approximately 100 kilometres from ANZAC Cove), conditions there were only better in that the men were out of range of Turkish guns. Even the nurses and doctors on Mudros were savaged by the prevalent illnesses of dysentery, diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. The flies were with them too.\n\nThat so much was done for the ill and the wounded was largely due to the unremitting efforts of Colonel Neville Howse, Chief Medical Officer of the lst Australian Division. As a young lieutenant in South Africa, Howse galloped into Boer fire to rescue a fallen trumpeter and treat his wounds and was honoured with the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. At Gallipoli he was the driving force behind the attempts to cope with the enormous medical problems the ANZACs faced. It was at his insistence that dentists were finally sent to Gallipoli midway through the campaign, and the incinerators he ordered built to burn soiled dressings and other litter were the only useful disposal system on the peninsula. Howse became Director-General of Medical Services for the Australian Military Forces and later, as a federal parliamentarian, Minister for Defence and Health, but it was in the field that his worth was recognised by the men whose lives were saved by his medical skill and organising ability.\n\nThere has never been a clear estimate made to show how many of the 10,000 ANZACs who died at Gallipoli were the victims of disease or of the impossibility of treating wounds properly under conditions as bad as any in war. Among the battles fought on that primitive peninsula, none was as unrelenting, as bitterly fought as that by the medical staff. But, like the campaign itself, it was a battle that ended in defeat - yet without loss of honour.",

Each has one vote but may nominate up to two representatives.\n\nThey comprise a broad cross-section of the community:\n\n- Pastoral — the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Uniting Churches.\n- Civic — The Brisbane City Council, the Queensland Department of Education and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n- Civil — The Royal United Services Institute of Queensland Incorporated, Toc H Australia Northern Region Incorporated and the Queensland Country Women’s Association.\n- Welfare — Defence Force Welfare Association, Salvation Army Red Shield Defence Services, and Australia War Widows (Queensland) Incorporated.\n- Service — Defence Joint Operations Support Services.\n- Ex-Service — The Council of Ex-Servicewomen’s Association, the Naval Association of Australia Incorporated, the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia Incorporated, the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans’ Association Incorporated and the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia Incorporated.\n\nQueensland’s unique ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has been a proudly non-aligned citizens’ organisation since its inception in 1916.\n\nToday it continues to prosecute the original aims for a \"holy day\" of commemoration rather than another public holiday festival.\n\nIt is a most successfully-managed and effective business which has survived because it is keeping abreast of modern business practices and capitalising on society’s patriotic resurgence.\n\nThe ADCC must endure because it will always represent the citizens’ gift of the people to Queensland’s war veterans.\n\nYou can also find out about the [ADCC Logo](/adcc-logo), our [Annual Badge Appeal](/proud-sponsors-of-the-annual-queensland-anzac-day-badge-appeal) or read a short history of the [ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee](/a-gift-of-the-people).\n\n![anzac day](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540887723/bralodxoiplhowl49bns.png)\n\nThe ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee as a registered charitable organisation is registered with the Australian Governments Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission (ACNC) and as such is permitted to display the ACNC [tick](http://www.acnc.gov.au/).\n\nThe ACNC has developed the [Tick](http://www.acnc.gov.au/) of Charity Registration for registered charities to show the public that they are registered with the ACNC.

      "content": "From its inception in 1916, the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has assumed the responsibility for educating the nation’s youth about the origins of ANZAC Day and for imparting the enduring lessons of self-sacrifice, mateship, perseverance, courage, devotion to duty and fidelity in the face of overwhelming odds that sprang from example of the men who fought at Gallipoli on the 25th day of April 1915, and which has been demonstrated ever after by those who serve their nation in time of war and peace.\n\nTo that end, an essay competition was conducted in 2015 to invite school students to express “What ANZAC Day Means To Me”.\n\n### ANZAC ESSAYS WIN TRIP OF A LIFETIME\n\n**The 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 2015 will always hold a very special place in the hearts and minds of two lucky children from Outback Queensland.**\n\nAiden Webster and Grace Peskett, both from Cunnamulla in south-western Queensland, entered an ANZAC Day research and essay competition conducted via Paroo Shire Council’s Cunnamulla Library.\n\nLibrarian, Tammy Hickey — assisted by teacher, Marg McLaren — saw this competition as a way to teach a younger generation all about the courage and sacrifices of our soldiers in a time when the world was at war.\n\nStudents were asked to research the events that inspired the legend of the ANZACs, to complete a quiz and write a 200-word essay entitled, “What ANZAC Day Means to Me”.\n\nAiden and Grace were judged the winners and their very strong family ties to World War I were amply demonstrated with their respective entries.\n\nA trip to Brisbane was the prize. And what a prize it was! With the help of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee each attended the Brisbane ANZAC Day Dawn Service and lay a wreath before witnessing just how the city honours The Fallen and holds dear all those who continue to defend our nation’s freedom.\n\nExtras on the trip included attending the Cosentino show at QPAC and meeting him after the show; enjoying a performance of Cirque Du Soleil; a lunchtime river cruise; a tour of the State Library of Queensland's Distant Lines exhibition — including a “white gloves” tour of war memorabilia; and a visit to the Amberley Aviation Heritage display.\n\n“Aiden and Grace met so many inspiring people during their Brisbane visit and will take many longlasting and cherished memories back to their family, friends and community in Cunnamulla,” Ms Hickey said.\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/qnwgwzfsfiimu3vegweh.pdf)\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/ttdawytaho67o3t3aetd.pdf)\n\n**In Pictures --**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468813/yogxkvbaaipdig6agfki.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace with ADCC President Arthur Burke OAM**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468854/jecefa7rjwqxlp2nb8rk.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace after Wreath Laying**\n<div class=\"list-group list-group-flush\">\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Themes</strong> -- Themes collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/themes\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Wars</strong> -- Collection of Wars history page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/wars\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Interactives</strong> -- Interactives collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/interactives\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Memorials</strong> -- Learn about some of the many memorials erected in Australia and other countries honouring Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/war-memorials\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Medals</strong> - A display of some of the medals awarded to Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/medals\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Classroom Activities</strong> - A selection of activities for upper primary and secondary pupils.

Young children have a fascination with all things to do with the past. By learning through hands-on, sensory and real-life experiences about ANZAC Day, young children will have an opportunity to understand the importance of this national day, and its role in building peace in communities today.\n\n## What will young children learn when they investigate ANZAC Day?\n\n<div class=\"list-group list-group-flush\">\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-start py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 mb-2 mb-sm-0\">\n<p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Studies of Society and Environment key learning area strands</strong></p>\n<p>Note: Refer to the Queensland Years 1 to 10 Studies of Society and Environment syllabus and supporting curriculum documents for further information. See the Queensland Studies Authority website at <a href=\"https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/\" target=\"_blank\">www.qsa.qld.edu.au/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7\">\n<p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Description of types of active learning about ANZAC Day</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that these descriptions of active learning about ANZAC Day will also connect well with quality, inquiry-based preschool/preparatory programs.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Time, Continuity and Change</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7 py-3\">Children look closely at, feel and talk about a range of artefacts about ANZAC Day, e.g. medals, photographs, parts of uniforms, copies of soldiers/families’ letters and ration items. Children talk with family/community members about what life was like during times of war. They compare how life is different during times of peace and war, and how war affects people.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Place and Space</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7\">Through making simple maps, e.g. relief and drawing, children learn about the landscape and of the distance travelled by the ANZACS to reach Gallipoli, Turkey, the Middle East, Belgium and France. They begin to understand the significance of some of the symbols that relate to the commemoration of ANZAC Day, including the poppy flowers that grew in the Belgian fields during and after the war.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Culture and Identity</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7\">Through conversations with family/community members, children learn about the range of roles and responsibilities of men, women and animals during wartimes and peacekeeping efforts. Children begin to understand the importance of ‘mateship’ as the ‘Diggers’ showed caring, compassion and friendship towards their mates as they battled in the trenches, in the air and on the sea. Children set up playspaces, e.g. hospital tent, plane hangar, submarine to roleplay their understandings about wartime roles/responsibilities of men/women in defence forces. To build understandings about the life of soldiers in battlefields, children may plan and cook a typical meal, e.g. cook hard tack (biscuits), eat bully beef (canned meat) and drink black tea</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-5 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Systems, Resources and Power</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-7\">Children join in school, class and family activities about ANZAC Day, e.g. marching in community ANZAC Day parades, making and laying of wreaths, and selling of ANZAC Day badges and poppies. With teacher support, children may plan for and prepare a special morning tea/lunch gathering with past and present Defence Force personnel from the local community. They may provide ideas about the design of a school/community ANZAC Day memorial project, e.g. monument, plaque, wall mural or special garden.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## What quality information and resources will assist teachers when planning programs about ANZAC Day?\n\nOn this website there are considerable resources giving background and detailed information on conflicts relating to ANZAC Day.

In 1914, Australia had a population of fewer than 5 million, yet 300,000 from all walks of life volunteered to fight. Of these, more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner.Just Soldiers by Darryl Kelly\n\nThrough these stories, based on fact, the author has endeavoured to capture the essence of those who served Australia as members of the 1st Australian Imperial Force in the Great War of 1914-1918. As in life, not all were heroes. Illustrated with B&W images to depict the conditions under which these Australians lived and fought.\n\nNB: All rights reserved.

Stand alone. Lawrence Walter Barber was born in February 1894 and some might say he was destined to be a soldier. He was raised in the Sydney suburb of Granville and joined the compulsory, military cadet scheme at the age of 12.\n\n*As the line was re-established, B Company, 36th Battalion moved forward. When Captain Gadd reached the beleaguered Lewis gun position, he found Barber slumped against the gun with his face in his hands, totally exhausted. He was the sole survivor.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Captain Frank Bethune, MC](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540957812/h82cjirz8mlct5pcanpd.pdf). Fight to the death. Frank Pogson Bethune was a quiet, unassuming clergyman from Tasmania. He enlisted in the AIF in Hobart on the 1 July 1915 with the rank of second lieutenant. For reasons of his own, Frank chose to take up arms instead of serving as a padre.\n\n*And hold they did, for 18 days the section repulsed attack after attack. They were subjected to constant artillery barrages of high explosive, shrapnel and gas shells, but they held their ground.*\n\n<hr/> \n\n[Major Percy Black, DSO, DCM](). On 13 September 1914, Percy Charles Herbert Black, a 34-year-old Victorian, enlisted in the AIF in Western Australia where he had been prospecting for gold. He commenced his military career at the Blackboy Hill Camp near Perth as a member of the machine-gun section of the 16th Battalion.\n\n*‘…the bravest and coolest of all the brave men I know.’*\n\n <hr/>\n\n[Trooper Sloan ‘Scotty’ Bolton, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kwewcfdyt7fdivrc54o2.pdf). The Beersheba charger. Allocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area.\n\n*Pushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard.   [Read more about Trooper Bolton.](/trooper-sloan-scotty-bolton-dcm)*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[WO2 Noel Eric Bolton-Wood](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ziu5feezbnj7pnjhyy3t.pdf). Age no barrier. Armed with a bogus letter of consent—supposedly written by his mother—the boy presented himself for enlistment in the AIF.1 The recruiting sergeant eyed him up and down suspiciously. ‘How old did you say you are, young fella?’ he asked.\n\n*Eric was a natural soldier and soon after being posted to the corps he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.2 At the tender age of only 16, Eric reputedly would be the youngest sergeant in the AIF.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Captain Benjamin Brodie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/cwirttcoygstrbitmfxn.pdf). The raider. Benjamin Greenup Brodie was a stalwart of the unit. He had enlisted as a private and from the earliest days displayed the leadership qualities that led to his rapid promotion through the ranks.\n\n*The men listened intently as he presented the plan in intricate detail. After each was assigned his task, the CO looked at the captain and said, ‘Brodie, you’ll be leading our blokes’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Gunner Robert Buie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/sjzxvus4caqjocniuyvq.pdf). Baron beware. Robert Buie was born in the little village of Brooklyn, New South Wales. He earned his livelihood fishing the waters of the Hawkesbury River, then selling his catch to markets in and around North Sydney.\n\n*As the two planes headed towards the Digger, he concentrated his sights on the second aircraft, muttering under his breath, ‘Break right. Break right’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lance Corporal Charles Bunney](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/dmgs1srryed1q6d0naci.pdf). Unmarked but not forgotten. As revellers at home ushered in the 20th century, young soldiers representing the various states of Australia were pitched in battle against the Dutch-Afrikaner settlers, thousands of miles away on the South African veldt.\n\n*Bunney, hearing the commotion, went to investigate. As Bunney entered the room, the blood-splattered Johnson attacked, striking him on the head with the axe.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Corporal Ernest Corey, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/hsffbfax6lgdjjf9jzyc.pdf). One of a kind. Ernest Albert Corey was born in December 1891 at Green Hills, a small town nestled in the shadow of the Snowy Mountains. A lively lad, he grew up as one of eight children born to the family.\n\nThe stretcher-bearer crawled to the wounded Digger. Assessing the situation, he grabbed the man’s thumb and rammed it into the gaping bullet hole in his leg to stem the bleeding while he ripped open a shell dressing.\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Trooper Albert 'Tibby' Cotter](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/falm3zwouzpsyyeawa9k.pdf). The last test. Albert Cotter was born in Sydney on 3 December 1884.1 He lived with his parents in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe. From a young age, he answered to the nickname ‘Tibby’ and, like all boys, he enjoyed fishing and knocking about with his mates. But his one great passion was cricket.\n\n*The two adversaries faced each other from a little more than twenty metres. The sweat stung as it rolled down their brows and into their eyes. One contemplated his attack, the other his defence.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lance Corporal Francis Curran, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/bynaadjfk5lseh9fcxbu.pdf). The bomber. Francis Patrick Curran was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, in 1887. On joining the workforce, he became a carter and postman by trade. Young Frank was also a very keen sportsman, excelling at football and boxing. In September 1914, Australia, now at war by virtue of being a member of the British Commonwealth, called for volunteers to join a military force to go to Europe to fight the German oppressors.\n\n*With the skill and athleticism of an A-grade cricketer, the khaki-clad figure repeatedly fielded the hissing bombs in mid air as they flew towards him. With no time to hesitate, yet with deadly accuracy, he hurled them back to their senders.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Bombardier Cecil Edwards, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/d2uo1vmvcosmtw73h7s1.pdf). The artillery signaller. Cecil Francis Edwards was barely nineteen when Great Britain declared war on Germany. Cec was among the first to join the long queues of young Australian men eager to volunteer to serve their King and country.\n\n*The concussion of exploding shells rocked their senses. The screech of artillery fired from the field guns of both sides was deafening . . . but communications had to be maintained.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[2Lt Henry ‘Ernie’ Eibel](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ifqlidcdefvzgfpobrx5.pdf). The iceberg. On 21 September 1914, barely six weeks after the outbreak of the First World War, Henry ‘Ernie’ Eibel enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Like so many of the early volunteers, Ernie was a country lad.\n\n*Long, black belts of thick barbed wire formed a formidable barrier. Beyond the wire were reinforced concrete pillboxes, the deadly barrels of machine-guns jutting from the openings. The air was thick with bullets and the red-hot splinters of artillery rounds.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Edward Elart](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ciebdhqbyiro4qk5lklq.pdf). A man with a secret. As eager young volunteers skirted around him, a young man paused and stared intently at the building that housed Naval Headquarters. He was poised to go in, but, on the threshold, he changed his mind. Instead, he turned on his heel and headed towards the military barracks down the road, where some time later he stood before the officer, raised his right hand and pledged, ‘I, Edward Elart, do hereby swear…‘\n\n*On the night of 6 June, he was ordered to go out again. ‘I’ll need a couple of blokes to go with me’, Freame said. A newly arrived lad by the name of Morris said he’d go and the other volunteer was Edward Elart.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Sergeant ‘Harry’ Freame, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/xji8hzbviw3aoptg0ick.pdf). The ANZAC ‘Bushido’. Harry Freame was born in 1880 in the Japanese city of Osaka. His parents were William Freame, an Australian working in Japan as an English teacher, and Shizu Kitagawa, whose Japanese ancestry dated back to the Shoguns of the 16th century.\n\n*Then, knowing that the information he had gathered was required by his commanding officer, Freame sprinted down the valley, drawing a furious hail of Turkish rifle and machine-gun fire as he went.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Chaplain Alfred Goller](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kyjieuynfcusrmsfugot.pdf). The insubordinate padre. Alfred Ernest Goller was born in Bannockburn, Victoria in July 1883. His parents were simple people with strong religious convictions, who had raised their son with the same set of values. Until the outbreak of war in 1914, he served the church in the Victorian country areas of Birchip and Mia Mia.\n\n*The commanding officer (CO) said, ‘You can fall out too, Padre'. ' No Sir’, was the reply. ‘If ever the men needed a chaplain, they need one now’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[2Lt Robert Graham, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kuhdn1akgmtoe2puhlgl.pdf). The soldier of fortune. Robert Louis Graham was born in Canada on 16 April 1876. The son of a superior criminal court judge, he spent much of his vacation time as a youngster among the friendly Indian tribes of central Canada.\n\n*When Bob Graham presented himself for enlistment in the AIF, the crusty old sergeant manning the desk asked, ‘Have you had any military experience, mate?’ ‘Yeah, a bit’, Graham replied.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private John ‘Barney’ Hines](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/wtfnnheyiov12fygme5b.pdf). The souvenir king. Born in Liverpool, England, Hines gave his age as 36 and his occupation as comprising a variety of trades—seaman, engineer, fireman, deep-sea diver and shearer. This was not Barney’s first experience of military life.\n\n*Later that day, Hines ventured out alone and destroyed another German machine-gun post. He was wounded during this latter action and spent the next six weeks recuperating in hospital.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Edwin Hoare](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/n2lxew2kyeobamtlifgj.pdf). Sorry mother. Edwin Cooper Hoare was British, born and bred. He worked hard as a fruit farmer to help support his parents. At the end of a hard day’s work, the young lad often wandered through the fields that surrounded his home in Hastings. He would try to imagine the famous battle that had been fought more than eight hundred years ago on the very ground where he now sat.\n\n*‘Why don’t you save your fight for the Germans, you pommy git?’ snarled one of the offenders. ‘What the hell would you know about fighting Germans?’ the young Englishman retorted.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lt Andrew Kirkwall-Smith, DSC, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/qwgax4p8qyara8gkiclo.pdf). Distinguished service in two wars. Andrew Kirkwall-Smith was born and raised in the tiny Scottish town of Kirkwall on the Orkney Islands. In the early 1900s, his family decided to escape the harshness of the Orkneys and try their luck in Australia.\n\n*He hid amongst the mangroves, his face buried in the mud. They were so close he could see the stitching on their boots. He dared not breathe. Discovery would undoubtedly result in his death.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Sergeant Donald MacKechnie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/iazggs5pjvreqxvk195h.pdf). The fraud. Prior to joining the AIF, 36-year-old Donald MacKechnie had served for 12 years in the British Army. As a young private in the Gordon Highlanders, he was a member of the Tirah Expedition of 1897, sent to quell a local uprising in north-western Afghanistan.\n\n*On the 18 April 1915, the army had had enough of MacKechnie’s antics and he was brought before a general court martial on a charge of drunkenness.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lt Col Charles Macnaghten, CMG](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/ouputyqaxkp5kzmzu4ob.pdf). The Duntroon deserter. Charles Melville Macnaghten was born in Rhutenpore in the Nuddhoea district of Bengal, India, on 18 November 1879. He was the son of Sir Melville Macnaghten who, in 1889—as Assistant Chief Constable, second in command of the Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard—was a leading investigator in the ‘Jack the Ripper’ murder case.\n\n*Macnaghten was leading some men forward again when he was shot through the chest. He tried to stay on his feet, but was shot again, this time through the throat. He staggered back to the dressing station, cursing his bad luck and wishing he could get back to the line with his men.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private William ‘Harry’ Malthouse](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/eyarejubj8kp3icaqiue.pdf). Shattered hopes. ‘Harry’ Malthouse presented himself for enlistment in the AIF on 13 July 1917, lowering his age by seven years to 46.\n\n*In late November, Phelps appealed to the doctor, once again, to allow Malthouse to be repatriated. The doctor considered carefully before he placed the old man’s name on the list of those to be sent home.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[LCpl John Mann, DCM, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/ej3ekdoj1etlguavaoi0.pdf). The Lewis gunner. John Henry ‘Jack’ Mann was born in England. Yearning for adventure, he set sail from his home to see the world. After a stint on the South African goldfields, Jack worked as a crew member on a windjammer that travelled the route between the Cape of Good Hope and the west coast of Australia, where the promise of riches attracted him to the local goldfields.\n\n*Jack Mann had survived his first terrifying battle. He had put drum after drum of ammunition through his Lewis gun and he had been responsible for his fair share of enemy casualties.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Privates Ina and Clement Moore](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/h7w0lwrj7i49b3rpryrd.pdf). The twins. As he passed the wriggling bundle to the midwife to clean and clothe, the doctor turned to the mother and said, ‘You have to keep pushing Mrs Moore, there’s another one’.\n\n*‘I’ve got something else of his too, mate. Here’s his notebook’, the other said. On comparing the items, they realized the initials were different. ‘Wonder if they were related?’ one asked.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Joseph Newman, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/hspiuj6sgm3nzibif51i.pdf). One that got away. Joseph Lewin Newman was posted to ‘C’ Company of the 2nd Division’s, 17th Battalion. He commenced military life at the main training camp at Liverpool, NSW—a vast ‘city’ of canvas stretching along the flat eastern bank of the Georges River.\n\n*Late one night, under the noses of guards—who still believed there was no risk of escape—Newman and his two comrades climbed out of a window and simply vanished into the darkness.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Arthur Oldring](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/ibshq3nae4nb5pvsq39z.pdf). No place to hide. On 27 December 1916, a 44-year-old man with ferret-like features walked into the Adelaide recruiting centre to enlist in the AIF. Giving his name as Arthur Geoffrey Oldring, the man was allocated as a reinforcement to the 8th Machine Gun Company and was sent to the Victorian town of Seymour for basic training.\n\n*As the brown, swirling waters of the flooded Goulburn River rushed by, a terrified woman watched transfixed as the blunt end of a tomahawk was swung towards her head.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Sister Alice Ross-King, ARRC, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/idjnsdjeofwbid55q9oy.pdf). Front-line angel. Alys Ross was born in the Victorian town of Ballarat, in August 1891.2 She was of hardy Scottish stock and while she was still a toddler, her father had moved the family to Perth in search of a better life.\n\n*She heard the whistle of falling bombs just before one of the missiles exploded directly in front of her, knocking her to the ground.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Alexander Sast](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/vxhjmjgnnxuhw2ttllnv.pdf). Unbroken silence. Russian-born Alexander Sast was no stranger to military service. After completing his training as a fitter with the Government Railways in Odessa, he enlisted in the Russian Navy and served for five years in the Baltic Fleet. Yearning for a better life, he left the Navy and made his way to Australia.\n\n*The strong smell of ammonia permeated the nostrils of the unconscious form suspended from the ring attached to the ceiling. The Digger stirred in response, roused by the smell and the excruciating pain in both arms and shoulder joints.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Noble Stephenson](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/b3rix84qp4lzhfo10xy8.pdf). Dead or alive? Noble Stephenson had been a member of the local militia unit for the past six months and he knew exactly what those words meant. He felt sure that he would be called upon to do his bit.\n\n*She looked deep into the soldier’s eyes, then turned to the officer, shook her head and said, ‘No, it isn’t’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Stanley Treloar, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/kacsygkwmeeoahvxtnrf.pdf). The pocket dynamo. Stan Treloar, a nuggetty little fellow from Creswick, Victoria, was the son of a minister, but he possessed a larrikin streak that did not conform with one raised in such a religious family.\n\n*When the danger had passed, Stan got up, shook off the dirt and turned towards where he’d last seen his mate ‘C’mon cobber, let’s keep going.’ But his friend could not answer—he’d been blown to bits.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Gunner William Vandertak](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/denuodlwy2cyrsyampva.pdf). A fight for a belief. William Vandertak was 22 years old when he enlisted in the AIF, following the outbreak of the Great War. A labourer from Wagga Wagga, Vandertak was assigned to the 13th Battalion of the 4th Brigade.\n\n*When he entered, he could not believe his eyes. An Australian officer was toasting the Kaiser’s health. The usually quiet Vandertak was overcome by a fit of rage and disgust. He stormed towards his superior and angrily tore off the offending officer's insignia of rank.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Richard Warne, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/zrrgzszbhpvamixvaugf.pdf). Within sight of home. Richard Warne was born to simple country folk in Maryborough, Queensland, in 1898. A boy of the land, he worked hard on the family farm at Owanyilla in support of his family’s endeavour to eke out a living.\n\n*The sequence of events that followed can only be described as a horrible twist of fate. The train was going too fast.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lance Corporal Vernon Warner](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/kkc85grar6apruylgdsx.pdf). Lucky to be alive. As the ranks of the 4th Battalion came into view, Enid Warner struggled to see through the cheering crowd standing shoulder to shoulder on both sides of the street. She was desperate to catch a last glimpse of her husband, Vernon.\n\n*The soldier contemplated the empty sleeve of his pyjama coat then turned his attention to the damaged bible he held in his hand. He stared long and hard at the bullet that lay embedded in the pages of the book as he came to grips with how close he had been to death.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Sergeant William Wass, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/ilqq6wn8bhkfylm3ooy7.pdf). Only a dog tag. William Wass was born in Derby, England. He chose the life of a professional soldier and at an early age enlisted in the British Army, assigned to the local regiment, the Sherwood Foresters.\n\n*The machine-gun fire was murderous; it seemed to be coming from all directions at the same time. The Diggers unsuccessfully tried to edge their way forward as time and time again they stopped to burrow their faces into the ground in an attempt to avoid the barrage of bullets.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Corporal William Webb](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/bfbvvicqbxzzkcwms7eu.pdf). The survivor. William Purnell Webb was born in Cheddar, England in October 1896. He came to Australia in search of a better life. On 6 February 1915, young Bill enlisted in the AIF. A competent horseman, he was allocated as a reinforcement to Queensland’s 11th Light Horse Regiment.\n\n*‘Are you American?’ came the question from the direction of the ship. ‘No,’ replied the POWs. ‘Are you British?’ ‘No, we’re Australian,’ shouted the prisoners.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Charles Williamson, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958422/gfkc3ge7askismlhkf6j.pdf). Ask no questions. The man who appeared, wraithlike in the dust of ANZAC, was already the veteran of a number of military campaigns.

      "content": "## The Beersheba Charger\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\nIn the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n\n![beersheba charger](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966655/iko3pwguzb8rgb6cx2ho.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

New recruits to the AIF pause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n\n![bolton](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966932/obb5ng89z6vjtbdahwh6.jpg)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n\n![painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966983/f1uhyanvjxttzb1lmvwv.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![beersheba painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967034/kk0uu2ya3uczn22pe9fs.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Depicts the men and horses of the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade encountering Turkish trenches and defending Turkish soldiers. A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n\n![beersheba charge](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967116/wh788toyzuetdv1y7unw.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n\n![beersheba map](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967193/kds7eptf2yfpbtrqh60l.jpg)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres.

It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n\n![Scotty and his wife, Elsie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967358/k0dmuwblovdqtc2rcieq.jpg)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

          "content": "## The Beersheba Charger\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\nIn the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n\n![beersheba charger](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966655/iko3pwguzb8rgb6cx2ho.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

New recruits to the AIF pause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n\n![bolton](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966932/obb5ng89z6vjtbdahwh6.jpg)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n\n![painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966983/f1uhyanvjxttzb1lmvwv.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![beersheba painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967034/kk0uu2ya3uczn22pe9fs.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Depicts the men and horses of the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade encountering Turkish trenches and defending Turkish soldiers. A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n\n![beersheba charge](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967116/wh788toyzuetdv1y7unw.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n\n![beersheba map](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967193/kds7eptf2yfpbtrqh60l.jpg)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n\n![governor residence](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967233/hck4zrlt7yforpmrne2e.jpg)\n\n**The author (R) outside the old Governor’s residence, Beersheba. It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n\n![Scotty and his wife, Elsie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967358/k0dmuwblovdqtc2rcieq.jpg)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

          "content": "Just before the ANZACs landed at Gallipoli on the morning of 25 April 1915 an Australian submarine, the AE2 set out on an historic journey. Its mission was to force a passage up the treacherous Dardanelles Strait into the Sea of Marmara, and then, in the words of the Chief of Staff, 'Generally run amok.' Such an extraordinary order required an extraordinary captain and luckily the AE2 had such a captain, Lieutenant Commander Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker -- an Irishman.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491754/nkh8h6lm2wjlovdoeenq.png) \n\n**Lieutenant Commander Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker. Photo courtesy Fred and Elizabeth Brenchley.**\n\nHenry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker, the second son of a physician, was born in Dublin on 2 February 1885. At the age of 12 he went to England to enter a school which specialised in training boys to pass the entrance examination for the Royal Navy, which he eventually joined at 15. After three years service aboard HMS Implacable, he applied to join the fledgling submarine service. Within two years he was promoted to lieutenant and obtained his first command -- HM Submarine A10.\n\nBy 1914 he was an experienced submariner and was chosen to command AE2, one of the two new submarines built at Barrow-in-Furness for the Australian Navy. Despite the fact that the rudimentary submarines of that era had never managed to sail more than 200 miles without breaking down, the intrepid Stoker and his mixed crew of Australian and English ratings -- in company with the other Australian submarine AE1 -- set sail for Australia on 2 March 1914. On 24 May 1914, after an incredible voyage of 83 days of which 60 were at sea, the two submarines made their entrance into Sydney Harbour. They were the first submarines to travel such a distance.\n\nSoon after their arrival in Australia, the AE1 and AE2 were sent north to assist in the Australian occupation of German New Guinea. AE1 was mysteriously lost with all hands during the mission. However, Stoker and AE2 successfully returned to Australia. Immediately on his return, Stoker in his flamboyant style, bailed up the Australian Defence Minister -- behind the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives -- and talked him into sending the AE2 back to Europe to assist in the European war. Not content with doing the historic England-Australia voyage once, Stoker and the AE2 set off back to Europe in December 1914. However, he only got as far as the Mediterranean before being ordered to join the British fleet at Tenedos Island and patrol the entrance to the Dardanelles. It was the start of the Gallipoli Campaign.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491787/gfyhc5ztyezgu6hmpu43.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Port bow view of HMA Submarine AE2 on arrival at Portsmouth, England, to prepare for the voyage to Australia.**\n\nAccording to Stoker, in his gripping autobiography Straws in the Wind, he quickly 'formed the opinion that an attempt to dive a submarine right through the Dardanelles Strait and into the Sea of Marmara held sufficient chance of success to justify the attempt being made'. The psychological advantage of entering the Sea of Marmara and thereby threatening Constantinople from the sea would be enormous.\n\nHowever, the difficulties were tremendous. The Strait was thirty-five miles long with a continuous current running at five knots back into the Mediterranean. The whole area was heavily mined, and although a submarine could dive under the mines with its periscope submerged it had to remain at periscope depth in order to navigate the narrow Strait. If it cleared the minefield, the submarine would be in narrow waters, completely controlled by the Turkish Navy.\n\nDespite the fact that the British submarine, the E15, had just been lost attempting to force the Strait, Stoker badgered the Admiralty with letters requesting an opportunity to make an attempt. Finally Stoker was received by the Chief of Staff, Commodore Roger Keyes and told he would be permitted to try. Admiral Sir John De Robeck, the Vice-Admiral of the Mediterranean Fleet told Stoker that 'if you succeed there is no calculating the result it will cause, and it may well be that you have done more to finish the war than any other act accomplished'. As Michael White remarked in his book, Australian Submarines, 'these were heady words for any man to have addressed to him, let alone one such as Stoker who had already shown outstanding qualities of enterprise and daring'.\n\nAt 2.30 am on the morning of 25 April 1915, Stoker weighed anchor and set out on the attempt to run the Dardanelles Strait, which would forever assure him of a place in Australian naval history. His plan was basically simple -- travel as far as possible on the surface to conserve his limited battery power, and dive at daylight or when he reached the minefields.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491827/umbv8podwvdgz9zwm01u.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491839/woallpc9gadorikkphvh.png)\n\n**The map at the top is a magnified section of the marked rectangular section of the map at bottom.**\n\nThe night of 25 April was a beautiful dark and calm night and the AE2 proceeded along at seven knots in the centre of the Strait. Suddenly they were spotted by the searchlight at Kephez and shells began to rain down. Stoker quickly submerged and passed a harrowing hour slowly creeping under the minefield. He could hear the mooring wires of the mines scraping the sides of AE2. 'Choose a wrong moment to rise for observation through the periscope and you choose a moment to hit a mine -- so choose as few of these moments as possible', Stoker dryly observed in Straws in the Wind. Rising twice in the minefield, Stoker realised he was travelling faster than he had anticipated. When he rose for the third time, he was pleased to find himself through the minefield and only three hundred yards below the famous Narrows.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491866/ji08joah5a1chrklbmcr.png)\n\n**Artist's impression of AE2's Dardanelles journey. (Artist unknown; Royal Naval Submarine Museum, Gosport, UK). Photo courtesy Fred and Elizabeth Brenchley.**\n\nThe Turks were now well aware of the AE2's presence and soon a small cruiser and a number of destroyers were attacking the submarine. Stoker fired a torpedo which missed the cruiser but it struck and damaged one of the destroyers. Submerged and trying to escape the destroyers' attempts to ram him, Stoker hit the bottom hard and slid up to a depth of 10 feet, right under the guns of a shore-based fort. The position was perilous. AE2 was fast aground with almost half of its structure out of the water. Stoker described it 'as unpleasant as it well could be'. Luckily they were so close to the fort that the guns could not be depressed enough to hit the submarine and after a short time the efforts of the crew to refloat AE2were successful. One of the crew recorded in his diary:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">During all this the Captain remained extremely cool, for all depended on him at this stage. It is due to his coolness that I am now writing this account. Nobody knows what a terrible strain it is on the nerves to undergo anything like this, especially the Captain, as all depends on him.</p>\n\nStoker and his crew resumed their journey pursued by dozens of Turkish warships. Antisubmarine warfare was in its infancy and the only way the Turks could attack the AE2 was by trying to ram her. As long as AE2 could stay submerged, it was relatively safe. However navigating the narrow strait was impossible without frequently coming up to periscope depth to take a sighting. Whenever they lifted the periscope, the Turkish ships attempted to ram. Stoker decided to run the AE2 on to an underwater bank and sit on the bottom until dark.\n\nFor sixteen hours the dauntless Stoker and his crew sat in darkness and silence at a depth of 80 feet. When they finally rose to the surface they found themselves about half a mile from the shore in a bay above Nagara Point -- the worst of their journey was now behind them. Stoker sent a radio message back to the fleet but never received an answer, and consequently was unsure if the message had been received. He was to learn much later that the message was indeed received, and that his message was to change the course of history.\n\nThe Allied landings on the Gallipoli peninsular had been met with fierce resistance. From their position on the beach General Bridges and his staff were alarmed at the ANZACs position and requested that they be withdrawn back to the fleet. Just as Stoker's message was received, a midnight conference was being held on the flagship Queen Elizabeth to decide whether to withdraw the troops off the peninsular.\n\nA friend of Stoker's, Lieutenant Commander C G Brodie, ignored requests to keep quiet and read to the conference Stoker's message heralding AE2's success. 'The psychological impact at that precise time was momentous', Michael White said in Australian Submarines. It will never be known if they were actually going to pull the troops off Gallipoli, but after Stoker's message was read Hamilton sent his famous 'dig, dig, dig' message to the Australians:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Your news is indeed serious. But there is nothing for it but to dig yourselves right in and stick it out. It would take at least two days to re-embark you, as Admiral Thursby will explain to you. Meanwhile the Australian submarine has got up through the Narrows and has torpedoed a gunboat at Chanak. P S You have got through the difficult business. Now you have only to dig, dig, dig, until you are safe.</p>\n\nThe news of the AE2's achievement spread to the Diggers clinging to the Gallipoli cliffs and lifted their morale. A notice was stuck on a shell-shattered stump on the hillside:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">'Australian sub AE2 just through the Dardanelles. Advance Australia'.</p>\n\nMeanwhile Stoker was pressing on in AE2 towards the Sea of Marmara. He encountered two Turkish warships and fired a torpedo at the largest but was unsuccessful. After spending the night of 25-26 April on the surface, AE2 finally entered the Sea of Marmara early in the morning of 26 April. Their mission now was to prevent Turkish ships transporting troops across the Marmara to Gallipoli.\n\nSpotting a likely target Stoker fired one of his precious torpedoes but again missed. He spent the remainder of the day on the surface sailing among fishing boats and doing all he could to broadcast the arrival of an allied submarine in the Marmara. After dark, Stoker again attempted to contact the fleet by wireless but was forced to dive constantly to escape Turkish patrol vessels.\n\nAt dawn Stoker resumed the offensive and fired a torpedo at a ship which was accompanied by two destroyers. The torpedo's engine failed to start and Stoker just managed to avoid being rammed by one of the destroyers. No other ships were sighted for the rest of the day which shows that the AE2's presence was curtailing Turkish ship movements.\n\nBy the morning of the 29th, Stoker was still sailing in the Sea of Marmara and harassing any Turkish ship he could find. However, he was now down to one torpedo which he decided to keep in reserve. His plan was to sail around, be as provocative as possible, and try to fool the Turks into believing that more than one submarine had made it to the Sea.\n\nEarly on the evening of the 29th, while sailing towards Marmara Island, the crew ofAE2 was surprised to encounter another submarine. It was the British submarineE14 under the command of Captain Boyle, which had been dispatched after the Admiralty heard of Stoker's successful passage up the Strait. Boyle asked Stoker what he planned to do the next day. It had been Stoker's intention to sail to Constantinople but Boyle, being the senior officer, overruled that plan and arranged to rendezvous with Stoker the next morning. This decision would seal the fate ofAE2 and her gallant crew.\n\nWhen Stoker surfaced at the rendezvous at 10am, he observed a torpedo boat and immediately dived. For some unaccountable reason the AE2 suddenly went out of control and began rapidly to rise. The submarine shot to the surface about 100 yards from the torpedo boat which opened fire. Stoker again attempted to dive but the AE2 was out of control and began to plunge into the depths.\n\nStoker took the prescribed emergency action and arrested the descent, but nowAE2 rushed back towards the surface where it was hit by shells from the attacking boat and was holed in several places. AE2 was doomed. Stoker ordered the submarine scuttled and concentrated on saving the lives of his men.\n\nAll the crew survived and were taken prisoner, and together with Stoker spent the next three-and-a-half years as 'guests' of the Turks. Stoker escaped twice but was recaptured and endured numerous hardships in Turkish prisons.\n\nAfter repatriation he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was offered the command of a cruiser but chose to leave the Navy for a career on the stage. He appeared in a number of plays, films and television dramas. His contemporaries included Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Mills.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out Stoker rejoined the Navy, and served for the duration.\n\nThe larger-than-life Stoker died on his 81st birthday in 1966.\n\nWhile Australia takes justifiable pride in the heroism of the ANZACs, and Simpson and his donkey are part of the nation's folklore, little is known of the dauntless Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker. Yet this man sailed a submarine around the world, and pulled off one of the most daring exploits in naval history. His achievements deserve to be placed firmly in history; he caused the Turks to abandon attempts to reinforce Gallipoli by sea, and forced them to use a much more hazardous land route. His success changed the whole course of the Gallipoli Campaign. As searchers now successfully have located the sunken hull of AE2, it's time that the intrepid Stoker and his crew were awarded their place in Australian history.\n\n**References**\n\nMichael W D White, Australian Submarines: A History, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1992.\nFred and Elizabeth Brenchley, Stoker's Submarine, HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001.\nH H G D Stoker, Straws in the Wind, Herbert Jenkins, London, 1925.\n\nI wish to express my thanks to Primrose Stoker, Stoker's niece, who supplied me with many details of Stoker's life.",

During the months of October and November 1914 British forces drove a bulge into the German front line on the Western Front about 20 kilometres long and no more than five kilometres deep. This bulge was known as the Ypres Salient and was located close to and east of the historic city of Ypres. It has often been referred to as one of the most infamous killing fields on the Western Front during World War 1. It claimed over one million casualties and between late 1916 and October 1917 all five Divisions of the AIF were involved in the fierce fighting that took place there. In the Battles of Broodseinde, Menin Road, Messines and Passchendaele, thousands of Australians were killed or wounded. If there are three words which would best describe the Ypres Salient they would probably be Courage, Destruction and Death.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496239/xugftqasqm8p07flzrds.png)\n\n**Tyne Cot garden cemetery where 1,368 Australians are buried**\n\nThere was, however, one place in which those returning from the front line could find some relief from the traumas of war, and this was Talbot House in the small Belgian town of Poperinghe just 11 kilometres west of Ypres. In December 1915 Queensland born Army Chaplain, the Reverend P.B. (Tubby) Clayton opened a Soldiers Club here and right from the beginning it had a remarkable atmosphere.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496292/ri5wvvodfosprmwp2ltc.png)\n\n**Rev Dr PB Tubby Clayton CH, MC, DD.**\n\nHere is what one young soldier wrote about Talbot House:\n\n\"Through an elaborate, iron-grilled doorway I could hear the sound of laughter and music, and pushing through the door I found myself at once in a different world. It was amazing. I felt like Alice when she stepped through the looking glass. There were soldiers all round me, of course, and Army slang in the air, but in stepping across that threshold, I seemed to have left behind me all the depression and weariness of the streets outside.\n\nHere it was that war-torn men found a haven of rest - a place where they tried to forget; yes a spot where peace and quiet were actually found even amidst the noise of war. Here we found the fellowship we longed for, yet so difficult to get.\n\nThe house was, indeed, all that it professed to be - a home away from home. Army orders and army ranks were left outside. It could scarcely be otherwise, for up there in the Upper Room, General and Private knelt side by side in front of the Carpenters Bench; a room so sacred to many of us that it grows more hallowed with the passing of time.\"\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496323/wacrkxhfpz7l4qv9pj9s.png)\n\n**The Carpenters Bench (The Altar) in Talbot House today.**\n\nThe Upper Room was the Chapel and it was situated in the loft of Talbot House on the fourth floor. Over 50,000 young men used it from 1915 to 1918; it did much to recharge their spiritual batteries. One young soldier left this anonymous and moving note in the Upper Room just before he left for the front line:\n\nWill you pray earnestly for me that I may have strength given to me to do that which is right and to make an effort to help others; not so much by what I say, but by my whole life. I have wandered away very far, but I want to put things right; and the prayers of Talbot House will mean much to me.\n\nCompassion, Caring, Understanding, Fair-mindedness, Service were all ideals which were espoused by the men who knew Talbot House, and above the door which opened on to the street hung a large sign which read \"Everymans Club 1915 -?\".\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496347/od5190ibgwurtmdgd8hz.png)\n\n**Talbot House, 1915.**\n**The sign above the front door reads: \"TALBOT HOUSE 1915-? Every•Man's CLUB\".**\n\nIt is not known how many Australians went to Talbot House from 1915 to 1918, but as all five Australian divisions passed through Poperinghe on their way to the Ypres Salient there would have been many who found their way to it. Many also spent time there on their way back from the front line. Amongst those was Corporal Jim Arkell of the 7th Australian Field Ambulance and he visited the House on several occasions. He and Tubby Clayton became close friends.\n\nAnd so amidst the horrors of war an ideal was born, a lofty ideal and it found expression in a world wide movement called simply Toc H, the Army signallers code word for Talbot House.\n\nAfter the war ended all of those who had known Tubby Clayton and Talbot House decided that the ideals for which the House stood should never be lost and in 1922 the Toc H Movement received its Royal Charter. In 1923 the then Governor General of Australia, Lord Forster, wrote to Tubby Clayton saying that he and Lady Forster would like to give a Toc H Lamp in memory of their two sons who had died in the Great War. The Lamp reached Australia in 1925 and has since then been enshrined in Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle. It is the parent lamp of Toc H Australia.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496398/fkusworq3bixr2t8fq43.png)\n\n**The symbol of Toc H is a lighted lamp.**\n\nFrom 1925 to the outbreak of World War 2 Toc H spread rapidly to all Australian States and its members built a fine tradition of 'Caring for People' carrying on the ideals for which Talbot House stood. They pioneered the Blood Transfusion Service, the Junior Farmers Movement, the Royal Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme and the Camping Program for children in need or with disabilities. In Brisbane in 1926 children from the Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital were taken to the Brisbane Exhibition. (This project continues to this day and in 2000, ninety children were involved). Jim Arkell played a leading role in Toc H in Queensland for almost fifty years and for his outstanding service was awarded the MBE.\n\nDuring World War 2 many Toc H members served in the armed forces. Thus it was not uncommon to find Toc H groups in many units. In Changi prisoner of war camp there were three Toc H groups. Around Australia Toc H Services Clubs were established in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns. Tens of thousands of men and women used them, and the one in Cairns was even called Talbot House.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496422/yvtncigkbo2bixafymlc.png)\n\n**The Toc H Rushlight used by Toc H members in Changi POW Camp, 1942 - 1945.**\n\nWorld War 2 had a big impact on Toc H in Australia. Membership was reduced and many branches closed. In spite of this the movement continued and has been led by many well known Australians - Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, Senator Neville Bonner, Sir William Keys and many more. Toc H members work on the principle that although there are many welfare agencies around and although vast sums of money are spent annually on all sorts of worthwhile community projects there are still many people who are in need. The real job of any Toc H member or branch is to seek out these people and to respond to their needs.\n\nThroughout Australia Toc H members work quietly on problems like loneliness, old age and reconciliation. One major focus today is on youth and for the past fifteen years Toc H has conducted very successful Youth Leadership Training Programs around Australia. Many who have been through these programs are already in leadership roles in the community. Since 1947 Toc H Queensland has hosted the Midnight Service inside the Shrine of Remembrance, ANZAC Square, Brisbane on ANZAC Eve and in 2000 it was supported by the largest crowd since it was first held. Most of those present were under thirty years of age and many were involved in the service. Prior to the Service an evening entitled We Will Remember Them - Flanders Fields and Beyond was held and it too was very well supported.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496444/myzlvr4q9q3gmuep50sd.png)\n\n**The garden at Talbot House today.**\n\nAnd so the Spirit of Toc H which had its roots in the darkest years of World War 1 on the Western Front lives on. Talbot House in Poperinghe continues to inspire the movement. It is the same as it was in 1915 and is visited by tens of thousands of people from all round the world every year. In a very real sense Toc H is a living memorial, not only to those who passed through the doors of Talbot House during World War 1 but also to those who have unselfishly given their lives in service to their country. There is a saying in Toc H that goes *\"Service to others is the rent we pay for our room on earth\"*.\n\n",

          "content": "The acronym ANZAC was coined in 1915 when Australian and New Zealand troops were training in Egypt. The word ANZAC was eventually applied to all Australian and New Zealand soldiers in World War 1. The term is particularly associated with the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.\n\nANZAC Day was inaugurated on 25 April 1916 to commemorate the first anniversary of the landing of the ANZAC troops at Gallipoli.\n\nDuring World War 1 and World War 2, Australians were fiercely patriotic. This can best be described in the words, my country - right or wrong. The wives, mothers and girlfriends were concerned for the nutritional value of the food being supplied to their men. Here was a problem. Any food they sent to the fighting men had to be carried in the ships of the Merchant Navy. Most of these were lucky to maintain a speed of ten knots (18.5 kilometres per hour). Most had no refrigerated facilities, so any food sent had to be able to remain edible after periods in excess of two months. A body of women came up with the answer - a biscuit with all the nutritional values possible. The basis was a Scottish recipe using rolled oats which were used extensively in Scotland, especially for a heavy porridge that helped counteract the extremely cold climate.\n\nThe ingredients they used were rolled oats, sugar, plain flour, coconut, butter, golden syrup or treacle, bi-carbonate of soda and boiling water. All these items did not readily spoil. At first the biscuits were called Soldiers' Biscuits, but after the landing on Gallipoli, they were renamed ANZAC Biscuits.\n\nA point of interest is the lack of eggs to bind the ANZAC biscuit mixture together. Because of the war, many of the poultry farmers had joined the services, thus eggs were scarce. The binding agent for the biscuits was golden syrup or treacle. Eggs that were sent long distances were coated with a product called ke peg (like Vaseline) then packed in air tight containers filled with sand to cushion the eggs and keep out the air.\n\nAs the war drew on, many groups like the CWA (Country Women's Association), church committees, schools and other women's organisations devoted a great deal of time to the making of ANZAC biscuits. To ensure that the biscuits remained crisp, they were packed in used tins such as Billy Tea tins. You can see some of these tins appearing in your supermarket as exact replicas of the ones of earlier years. Look around. The tins were airtight, thus no moisture in the atmosphere was able to soak into the biscuits and make them soft.\n\nDuring World War 2, with refrigeration in so many merchant navy ships, the biscuits were not made to any great extent as it was now possible to send a greater variety of food such as fruit cake.\n\nANZAC biscuits are still made today. They can also be purchased from supermarkets and specialty biscuit shops. Around ANZAC Day, these biscuits are also often used by veterans' organisations to raise funds for the care and welfare of aged war veterans.\n\nCompiled from information supplied by the CWA, Brisbane, the War Widows Guild, Brisbane and Queensland State Headquarters of the RSL\n\n**A Favourite Recipe**\n\n1 cup rolled oats\n\n1 cup plain flour \n\n1 cup sugar\n\n3/4 (three-quarters) cup coconut\n\n125g (4 oz) butter\n\n2 tablespoons golden syrup\n\n½ (half) teaspoon bicarbonate of soda\n\n1 tablespoon boiling water\n\nCombine oats, sifted flour, sugar and coconut.\n\nCombine butter and golden syrup, stir over gentle heat until melted.\n\nMix soda with boiling water, add to melted butter mixture, stir into dry ingredients.\n\nTake teaspoonfuls of mixture and place on lightly greased oven trays; allow room for spreading.\n\nCook in slow oven (150°C or 300°F) for 20 minutes.\n\nLoosen while still warm, then cool on trays.\n\nMakes about 35.\n\n\n",

          "content": "Private Richard Warne MM 31st Battalion AIF \n\n\"Within Sight of Home\"\n\n**Acknowledgement**: This is one of a selection of stories written by Darryl Kelly about soldiers who served in WW1. It is intended that the stories soon be published as a book, “Just Soldiers\".\n\nSoldiers accept the risk of battle. The death, pain of wounds and the hidden fear of illness are commonplace. But fate can be a cruel and vicious player in the game and can deal you the worst of hands. This is one such story.\n\nRichard Warne was born to simple country folk in Maryborough, Queensland in 1898. A boy of the land, he worked hard on the family farm at Owanyilla to help meet his family's needs. He was bright at school and did well, but with not a lot of time on his hands, sport took second place. When a chance did arise, he relished a hard game of tennis.\n\nOn enlistment in the AIF in March of 1916, he was in a select group of recruits commonly known as \"The Fair Dinkums\". They were the recruits who knew what to expect after the carnage of Gallipoli, after the romanticism of the war had died with so many seeking the great adventure. Richard Warne was first posted to the ranks of the 41st Battalion. He relished his life in the military and adapted well to the rigours of training.\n\nIn May 1916 he boarded the troopship Demosthenes in Sydney. The ship was bound for England, for it was here that the diggers would hone their skills for the upcoming battles. In September 1916, Warne received his orders to embark for France.\nIt was at this point he found he was needed to help fill the ranks of the depleted 31st Battalion, which was engaged in heavy fighting at Flers.\n\nAs the young diggers moved up towards the line that first night, nothing in training could have prepared him for the sights, sounds and conditions he was about to experience. France was entering the worst winter in 100 years. Freezing cold, constant damp, knee deep mud and the constant presence of death were daily norms. The 31st Battalion, like all the units of the AIF, endured and held the enemy in these impossible conditions in this place called the Somme.\n\nIn February 1917, Warne was on a ration-carrying party supplying the front line. As the party weaved its way forward, the scream of artillery shells pierced the night. Diving to the ground, Warne and his carrying partner sought the safety of the mud. As the shells exploded, a red-hot splinter shattered the urn of boiling water they were carrying and drenched Warne's feet with its contents.\n\nAs the young soldier was carried to the dressing station, he pleaded not to have to leave his mates. The medics decided that the injury required specialist treatment in England and on the 8th of February 1917, Warne entered the Norfolk War Hospital. His stay was to last eight weeks.\n\nOn release from the hospital, Warne remained in England to assist in the training of recruits. When he read of the casualties and the loss of so many mates, he pestered his superiors to let him return to his battalion and the front so as to do his bit.\n\nIn October of 1917 he got his wish and re-embarked for France.\nIn November of that year Richard Warne had his first brush with the disciplinary side of the Army. He was charged with the serious crime of stealing. It wasn't money nor was it a mate's possessions, it was four pounds of apples (less than two kilos) which he had given to members of his section. He was found guilty and sentenced to one day's detention.\n\nThe 31st was again on the move through the carnage of the trenches. The shot, the shell, the death and destruction. The Aussies held their ground through the great German advance of April 1918.\n\nFinally the tide turned and they had Fritz on the run. It was now August 1918 and finally the Aussie Divisions were fighting side by side. The German General Ludendorff called it the \"Black Day\" of the German Army. At one point the 31st became bogged down and were driven back by accurate German artillery fire. The front was strewn with Australian wounded. Warne and a mate, Private Richard Stutz, also from Owanyilla, went out under heavy fire and dragged in their wounded mates. Both soldiers were awarded the Military Medal for their actions of that day. It is ironic, but after the war, Stutz would marry Warne's sister.\n\nBy now the Germans were retreating on all fronts with the Aussies hard on their heels. During an attack in September the 31st again came under heavy and accurate German artillery fire. A Lewis gun section which included Richard Warne sortied forward. They located the troublesome battery and engaged it with accurate small arms fire, serious enough to have the Germans temporarily abandon their guns. This respite allowed the 31st to move forward and continue the advance. Warne's name was submitted for a bar to his Military Medal, but it was not approved.\n\nAn armistice was declared on the 11th of November 1918. The battlefield adopted a strange, ghost-like silence. Finally the war was over. Private Richard Warne MM would have to wait his turn for a draft to go home. Those who had longer periods of service would be given first priority. He was sent to England on leave and took in the sights, sounds and celebrations of the allied victory.\n\nFinally the order came which he had waited three and a half years for. As the troopship neared the coast of Australia, diggers could swear they could smell the gum trees. Private Warne presented himself for a final medical board in Brisbane on the 22nd of August 1919. He was passed fit with no disabilities. He sent a telegram to his family stating that he would catch the first available train from Brisbane which was due in Owanyilla on the afternoon of the 25th.\n\nHe arranged to travel with Private George Black, also of the 31st. They had been the best of mates for the past 18 months and had looked out for each other, both in and out of the line. By a stroke of luck Warne was released on leave early and thought he would surprise his family by catching an earlier train which would arrive on the morning of the 25th of August.\n\nDuring the journey Warne learned the unbelievable - the train did not stop at Owanyilla. He asked if the driver would make a special allowance and make an unscheduled stop. The driver refused saying the best he could do was slow down to allow Warne to jump.\n\nAs the train slowed on its approach to Owanyilla around 5am, Warne glanced from the carriage. He could see the lights of his home and could imagine his mother cooking breakfast. Black walked with Warne to the carriage door, here they paused, shook hands and said their good-byes. As the platform came into view, Warne threw his kitbag from the train. It landed safely on the platform. He judged his time and jumped. Fate now took over. He found that the train was going too fast and he had missed the platform altogether. He bounced along the ground and hit a large rock with such force that it threw him under the wheels of the train. The wheels shattered the lower portion of his right leg. He was gashed about the head, had a compound fracture of the skull, and severe gravel rash over most of his body.\n\nAt about 7am, Mrs Eva Lay, the wife of a local linesman, made her way to the platform. Her job was to open the gates. She noticed the kitbag lying on the platform. Looking about she noticed the station was empty. Curiosity got the better of her and she made her way down the track. It was here she found the bloodied body of a young soldier. As she looked closer, she could see a slight rise and fall of his chest. It was the impossible. He was alive.\n\nBeing new to the area and with her husband away, she raced to the nearest farm for help. The farm was that of the Warne family. On arrival at the scene Richard and Clara Warne looked down at the battered form of the young soldier only to see that it was their own son, Richard.\n\nA series of telephone calls rattled along the ancient lines for the ambulance from Maryborough to be sent. On arrival the ambulance men did all they could. They placed young Richard in the back of the ambulance with his mother cradling her son's battered head. The ambulance sped towards Maryborough. As it approached the hospital, Private Richard Warne MM lost his final battle and died in his mother's arms.\n\nThe citizens of the Maryborough district contributed funds to have a memorial erected over the young soldier's grave. His mother never got over the death of her first born and secretly favourite child. She endured a further 41 years of the unbearable torture of his loss before she was finally laid to rest alongside him in 1960.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541570128/g8fcifkaaaozlpmsajhc.png)\n\nThe memorial.

          "content": "**The Beersheba Charger**\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\n*In the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.*\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571106/l34dfj02hy4tygp7hovz.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

New recruits to the AIF\npause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571148/avuthlx6xofj4h9rkoox.png)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571171/kywytacfbrqndz7wce8j.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571211/bpy2x3ny03rm3op5ybfa.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571293/pvfehdqfjkn8eh3fppxq.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571317/uasidic3mmeuc3bxfdvm.png)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres.

It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571432/pgcniihcrosc2gvkcd7j.png)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

The German light cruiser SMS Emden, aground and on fire after battle with the RAN light cruiser HMAS Sydney off Cocos-Keeling Islands, HMAS Sydney is visible in the far distance.**\n\nThe ships and men of the Royal Australian Navy operated as an integral part of the Royal Navy and served in all operational areas.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy’s first task was to protect Australia’s ports, shipping and trade routes. As part of securing Australia’s maritime frontiers, the RAN took part in the first amphibious assault of the war when it played a major role in the capture of the German New Guinea colony in the Pacific. On 14 September, a day after the official German surrender of the colony, the AE1, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant and accompanied by HMAS Parramatta, left Blanche Bay, New Britain, to patrol off Cape Gazelle. She was last seen by Parramatta at 3.30 pm that day and no trace has been found of her, or her company, since. The fate of the AE1 was never established, but it is probable that the submarine was caught on a coral reef and sank with the loss of all on board.\n\nAfter this operation, the ships of the RAN began the vital role of convoy escort. On 9 November 1914, whilst escorting a convoy near the Cocos Islands, the light cruiser HMAS Sydney was detached to investigate the sighting of a strange warship. This ship turned out to be the German light cruiser Emden. In the ensuing battle, Sydney destroyed the Emden and thus won the RAN’s first battle. The Sydney then served in the North Sea until the end of WW1, becoming the first ship to catapult a seaplane — on 8 December 1917.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571783/ozzvdrambvojwotp3pxe.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Ten minutes earlier, the cease fire had been given in her battle with the German cruiser Emden, which had run ashore onto a reef on North Direction Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Sydney then pursued the collier Buresk—appropriated by the Germans—at full speed, and sent armed men aboard her. However, the German crew took steps to ensure that the collier sank. The crew were taken off. **\n\nThe Navy also played a supporting role in the Gallipoli campaign when HMAS AE2 became the first allied warship to penetrate the Dardanelles — an operation which made the AE2 famous. The submarine, commanded by Lieutenant Commander H. S. Stoker, was ordered to sail through the Dardanelles and disrupt Turkish shipping in the Sea of Marmara. No other submarine had yet managed to breach the Turkish defences, but in the early hours of 25 April 1915, the AE2 got past minefields and land-based guns, and after torpedoing a Turkish destroyer, it reached the Sea of Marmora. The AE2 remained at large for five more days before sustaining irreparable damage while under heavy fire. Stoker was forced to sink the submarine and surrender. All the crew survived and were taken prisoner, and together with Stoker, spent the next three and a half years as ‘guests’ of the Turks. Stoker escaped twice but was recaptured. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order after the war.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571818/zuzfmlgcaejfhvzfzgnv.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Charles Bryant, HMAS Sydney’s *fight with a Zeppelin in the North Sea,* c. 1931, Painting: oil on canvas, 102 x 127.4 cm. ‘HMAS Sydney’s fight with a Zeppelin in the North Sea‘ portrays an unusual action involving the Australian light cruiser *Sydney* which took place on 4 May 1917. Under Captain John Dumaresq the cruiser was leading a British ship, *Dublin*, and four destroyers on a sweep of channels south east of Rosyth, Scotland, between the Forth and Humber estuaries, when the force came under attack from the German naval Zeppelin L43. The five-engined airship was first sighted shortly before 10.30am, approaching the east at about the same time as Dumaresq discovered that several submarines were in his vicinity. By charging in the dirigible’s direction and opening fire with anti-aircraft guns at extreme range, the cruisers forced the airship to rise steeply and veer off. As soon as Dumaresq ordered his force to resume its original course, the L43 began stalking the ships. After failing to gain a bomb dropping position on the Dublin, the Zeppelin targeted one of the destroyers and managed to land three bombs within ten metres of it. The airship captain then turned his attention to Sydney which began evasive action. The duel continued for two hours, drawing to an inconclusive end only after the Zeppelin ran out of bombs at about 2.30pm. By then the cruisers had also expended all ammunition for their high altitude guns. Both sides reportedly parted on good terms. *Sydney* had become the first Royal Australian Navy vessel to be subjected to an air attack.**\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571880/lbyam74rrqojw5fjrlnd.png)\n\n**The daunting task facing the AE2, of travelling through to the Sea of Marmara, is reflected in this map of the Dardanelles Strait (left).

This day was born out of the Gallipoli campaign, but how many people are aware of the involvement of the Merchant Navy in that campaign.\n\nThe merchant ships took all of our troops to Gallipoli, and in many cases landed our troops on the beach at ANZAC Cove in the ships’ lifeboats — manned by merchant seamen, who also came under the deadly fire from the Turkish guns.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the great majority of wounded in that campaign were taken in the ships’ lifeboats — with merchant seamen manning the oars — to the hospital ships which were waiting offshore. The merchant ships evacuated most of our troops from Gallipoli to Alexandria, Lemnos and Cyprus and then transported the wounded home to Australia.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572035/hi1z3lbf0fk3cqxj8wui.png)\n\nIn the foreground, French troops training on Lemnos Island prior to the Gallipoli landing.

From this modest beginning Australia became the only British dominion to set up a flying corps of its own for service during the First World War.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572238/ywa5k6ve6qiacuy8q5py.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Will Longstaff, War planes of the Australian Flying Corps, 1918-1919,\nPainting: oil on canvas, 236 x 141 cm.**\n\nKnown as the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and organised as a corps of the Australian Imperial Force, its four line squadrons usually served separately under the orders of Britain’s Royal Flying Corps. The AFC’s first complete flying unit, No.1 Squadron, left Australia for the Middle East in March 1916. By late 1917 three more squadrons, Nos.2, 3, and 4 had been formed to fight in France. A further four training squadrons based in England formed an Australian Training Wing to provide pilots for the Western Front.\n\nBefore No.1 squadron made its journey to the Middle East, Australian airmen had been in action in Mesopotamia. A Turkish threat to the Anglo-Persian oil pipeline and the strategically important area at the head of the Persian Gulf (the Shatt-el-Arab) convinced British strategists of the need to open a second front against the Turks. The Australian Government was asked to provide aircraft, airmen and transport to support the Anglo-Indian forces assigned to the campaign. It responded by dispatching four officers, 41 men, and transport—called the Mesopotamian Half Flight—in April 1915. Arriving too late to help secure the Shatt-el-Arab and the oil pipeline, the Half Flight joined the British advance on Baghdad, an operation intended to exert additional pressure on the Turks in the east.\n\nThe attempt to reach Baghdad failed, and some 13000 British and Indian troops found themselves besieged by superior Turkish forces in the city of Kut, about 80 miles south of their objective. Attempts to relieve the siege failed, and in April 1916 the garrison at Kut, including members of the Half Flight, surrendered. Taken prisoner by the Turks, few survived captivity. The defeat on the Tigris marked the end of Australia’s first experience of military aviation. The Mesopotamian Half Flight and No.1 Squadron were both formed early in the war, when military aviation was in its experimental stages, and both contained some of Australia’s aviation pioneers.\n\nThroughout 1916 and much of 1917 No.1 Squadron flew inferior aircraft such as the BE2c against German opponents who, supporting the Turkish armies in the Middle East, were equipped with more advanced Fokkers and Aviatiks. However, by the end of 1917, newly equipped with Bristol Fighters, the Allied airmen began to gain the ascendancy.\n\nArriving in England between December 1916 and March 1917 and doing eight months training before being sent to the Front, 2, 3 and 4 Squadrons began their active service at a time when the use of aircraft in war was far more developed.\n\nIt was different for members of the AFC who served in the Western Front squadrons. The days when enemy airmen waved to each other on reconnaissance flights were long gone. Aircraft now carried machine guns as standard equipment, and interrupter gears, developed in 1915, enabled pilots in single-seat fighters to fire straight ahead through their propellers.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572290/z8hhysttd9tk6c5pg7tr.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Treloar was one of the officers of the Mesopotamian Half Flight..**\n\nBy 1918 aircraft were being used in a variety of roles: some as fighters, others for reconnaissance or artillery spotting and others for bombing operations inside enemy territory.\n\nThe AFC’s best aircraft in the final year of the war were among the most technically advanced of the day. Bristol’s BF2b, a two-seat fighter-bomber known as the Bristol Fighter, could climb to 10000 feet in 11 minutes and fly at 113 miles an hour when it got there. The famous Sopwith Camel could reach 12000 feet in 12 minutes, fully loaded with weapons and ammunition, and fly as quickly as the Bristol Fighter. Pilots and observers sat exposed to the elements in noisy open cockpits.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572326/fcs343iykt5ufzygtciv.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Note the tail of the aircraft is supported so the aircraft can be in a level position for testing machine guns on the range prior to an offensive patrol.**\n\nGiven the nature of warfare on the Western Front, it is not difficult to imagine why men would seek to transfer into the AFC. Many had experienced the misery and squalor of the trenches. Those who knew they would face danger as long as they were in the AIF preferred to face it in a corps which offered the promise of independence and glamour, as well as a degree of comfort unknown to the men in the trenches. Those who served in the Middle East, although spared the worst miseries of the Western Front, shared a similar desire to escape their own discomforts: the sand, the dust and the flies. Men who had already served in the ground forces reasoned that if they survived the day’s flying they would at least have the chance to sleep in a comfortable bed.\n\nNot everyone, however, survived the day’s flying. Many pilots were killed in accidents long before they could join a line squadron. Over a third of the AFC’s wartime fatalities occurred in Britain. Some trainees died even after the war had ended: as one pilot wrote in March 1919:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">A great pal of mine was on his very last flight — his last test before qualifying … a mist arose, he flew into the ground and was killed. He had enlisted in 1914, gone through much front-line service, only to be killed on his absolute final exploit, four months after the armistice.</p>\n\nPilots who survived training were posted to operational squadrons where the thought of meeting the enemy in the sky was enough to give even the bravest men pause for thought. Harry Cobby, who went on to become the AFC’s leading ace, admitted his own fear at the thought of being posted to the front:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The nervousness that assailed me during the months of training in England, when I gave thought to the fact that as soon as I was qualified to fly an aeroplane, or perhaps sooner, I would be sent off to the war to do battle with the enemy in the sky and on the ground. I quite freely admit that if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour, I would have left nothing undone to bring it about.</p>\n\nCobby overcame his early fears to become a highly successful pilot. Others were less skilled or less fortunate. Owen Lewis, an observer in No.3 Squadron, was an experienced airman. An entry in his diary on a day when bad weather prevented flying reveals his feelings about operations: ‘This morning I was pleased when the weather was fairly dud -- I am afraid I am always pleased when that is so.’ His fears were justified. On 12 April 1918, the day after he had teamed up with a new pilot, both men were killed in action.\n\nTwo main types of aircraft were used by the AFC: two-seater reconnaissance planes, in which the observer, armed with machine guns, sat behind the pilot; and single-seater fighters. The latter dominated the popular imagination: they were the aces, flying the fastest aircraft and fighting duels with men like themselves above the trenches. In reality, aerial combat was a difficult skill to master, requiring split-second timing and complete mastery of one’s aircraft and weapons. A man in No.1 Squadron described a dog-fight as:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Every man for himself. We go hell-for-leather at those snub-nosed, black crossed busses of the Hun, and they at us ... Hectic work. Half-rolling, diving, zooming, stalling, ‘split-slipping’, by inches you miss collision with friend or foe. Cool precise marksmanship is out of the question.</p>\n\nHe was in fact the observer in a two-seater and thus did not have the opportunity to use a forward firing machine-gun. Those like Cobby who flew in fighters also found that in a dogfight, which by the end of the war, could involve up to 100 aircraft, hitting the enemy was very difficult:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The air was too crowded, there was little opportunity to settle down and have a steady shot at anything. You would no sooner pick out someone to have a crack at, than there would be the old familiar ‘pop-pop-pop-pop’ behind you, or you would just glimpse an enemy pilot getting into position to fire on yourself — so hard boot and stick one way to save your skin.</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572527/jpausbnpua870yp1qyyn.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

An Avro DH 5 fighter aircraft, found by the Australian Flying Corps to be a very good machine.**\n\nMost of Cobby’s kills appear to have been scored against unsuspecting victims over whom he had the advantage of surprise and speed.\n\nWhen two skilled opponents met in the air, the fight was often lengthy: both men knew that only one would survive. The German airman, Ernst Udet, described one such combat: ‘I tried every trick I knew, turns, loops, rolls and sideslips — but he followed each movement with lightning speed and gradually I began to realise that he was more than a match for me … the man was a superior duellist.’ When his guns jammed, Udet thought he was doomed; but he was lucky—his antagonist turned his aircraft upside down, waved farewell and dived towards the Allied line.\n\nAs Udet discovered, the air war could sometimes be chivalrous. As the Australian historian, F.M. Cutlack, wrote ‘the star airmen of the opposing armies regarded each other with a curious mixture of personal esteem and deadly hostility.’ Many toasts were drunk to Richthofen by men who would have gladly killed him given the chance. When he was killed, Australian airmen placed wreaths on his grave. In the Middle East Oberleutnant Gerhardt Felmy, the leading German pilot facing No.1 Squadron, earned the admiration of his adversaries. It was not uncommon for him to drop messages from and photographs of recently captured Australian airmen on their home field. The Australians did the same for the Germans and drank toasts to Felmy in their mess. On the Western Front captured enemy pilots were treated with respect by their Allied counterparts and vice-versa. In practice there was not much room for chivalry. In 1918 Australian pilots on the Western Front flew regular operations against enemy forces on the ground. ‘The job’, wrote Cobby,\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">‘consisted of getting to the ‘line’ … as fast and often as one could, and letting the enemy on the ground have it as hot and heavy as possible. … All this flying was done under 500 feet and our targets were point blank ones … The air was full of aircraft, and continuously while shooting-up the troops on the ground we would be attacked by enemy scouts … The smoke of the battle below mixed with the clouds and mist above rendered flying particularly dangerous. … On top of this there were scores of machine-guns devoting their time to making things as unpleasant for us as they could.’</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572611/xqzzgrsqtskzw2siz21k.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying on a bombing operation, saw a fellow squadron member, Captain D. W. Rutherford, shot down. Although having just suffered a serious leg wound, McNamara landed near the stricken Rutherford who climbed aboard, but his wound prevented McNamara from taking off and his aircraft crashed. The two men made it back to Rutherford’s plane which they succeeded in starting and, with McNamara at the controls, they took off just as enemy cavalry reached the scene.**\n\nSuch flights were both dangerous and exhausting. ‘I always emerged from them almost rigid with tension,’ commented Cobby. Nevertheless, they must have given pilots and observers the feel of an even contest. In September 1918, with the Turkish armies in full retreat, No.1 Squadron had a very different experience of attacking men on the ground.\n\nOn the morning of 21 September, British and Australian bombers discovered the main Turkish column passing through a gorge on the Wady Fara road. Having bombed the lead vehicles, trapping those behind on the narrow road, the airmen proceeded to destroy as many of the Turks as they could. Clive Conrick, an observer in No.1 Squadron, described the slaughter as he turned his machine guns on the trapped men below, many of whom sought to escape by climbing the cliffs above the road. Flying almost parallel to the fleeing men Conrick was close enough to see,\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">'chips of rock fly off the cliff face and red splotches suddenly appear on the Turks who would stop climbing and fall and their bodies were strewn along the base of the cliff like a lot of dirty rags. When Nunan [his pilot] was climbing again to renew his attack, I had a better opportunity to machine gun the troops and transports on the road.'</p>\n\nAs the attacks continued throughout the day, the Turkish survivors waved white flags. ‘But,’ wrote Conrick, ‘it was quite impossible for us to accept the surrender of the enemy, so we just kept on destroying them.’ Another No.1 Squadron observer, L. W. Sutherland, called it ‘sheer butchery’.\n\nAt the same time Sutherland recognised that he was witnessing a significant moment in the wartime use of aircraft. ‘A vitally important duty had been given to us,’ he wrote. ‘For the war, we, the newest arm of the service, had the most onerous work in a major operation. We were not going to fall down on our job. But oh, those killings! ... Only the lucky ones slept that night.’ Such one-sided encounters were relatively rare. Experiences like those of Cobby on the Western Front were more typical.\n\nIn an age when few had flown, many men found that flying could be fun. Donald Day, formerly of the Australian Army Medical Corps, became a pilot in May 1918. He transferred to the AFC too late to fly on operations and remained in England until the armistice, but he appreciated the joy that flying could bring:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">One of the finest experiences of flying is to closely examine the large fleecy white clouds. They contain features similar to very rugged country gullies, hills etc. In places the gully turns sharply, too much so for a turn, and into cloud one goes; no cloud with sun shining, the shadow of the machines may be seen surrounded by a complete rainbow halo.</p>\n\nEven the more reserved Lewis was able to appreciate the beauty of flying. On a bumpy flight one morning in February 1918 his nausea gave way to delight as his pilot broke through the clouds. ‘It was extremely beautiful. On one occasion we flew round a balloon which was over Ypres and we both waved to the balloonatic who answered in a like manner.’\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572696/aec216zjshwuowdm0ddo.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

These balloons made manned observation flights over enemy positions.**\n\nGiving young men control of what were then the most high-powered and sophisticated aircraft in production could also lead to mischief. Some pilots in No.1 Squadron devised a game called ‘feluccaring’ on account of its practice of flying around small boats — known as feluccas — in such a way as to make them capsize and sink, leaving the one-man crew to swim ashore. Such a thoughtless tactic, probably a game to the airmen, was unfortunately all too typical of the often racist attitudes of Australian troops to the people of the Middle East.\n\nDuring the last weeks of the fighting there, No.1 Squadron flew in support of the Allied advance into Palestine, moving from one airfield to another as their armies pursued the retreating Turks northwards. As armoured motor vehicles and cavalry raced to keep in touch with the fleeing Turks during October 1918, the only fighting that continued in the Middle East was in the air. The war against Turkey ended on 31 October 1918. No.1 Squadron returned to Egypt after the armistice and embarked for Australia in January 1919.\n\nThe war against Germany lasted only a few days longer. As the German Army on the Western Front retreated eastwards, their airmen continued to fight.\n\nOctober and early November 1918 were characterised by massive sweeps of Allied aircraft over the German lines. Combats were frequent as air battles continued and Allied airmen bombed and strafed the retreating Germans on the ground. Even on the last day of the war, No.2 Squadron was bombing the Germans while No.4 Squadron flew escort.\n\nAfter the armistice, No.4 Squadron became the only Australian unit of the British Army of Occupation, entering Germany on 7 December 1918. Each of the Australian squadrons that had served on the Western Front left Europe for home in early March 1919. During the war, 460 officers and 2234 men served in the AFC and 178 had been killed. By the standards of the First World War these casualties were light. The AFC was a pioneering corps, laying the groundwork for the Royal Australian Air Force and making a significant contribution to Australian civil aviation, through the efforts of men such as Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, MC, Sir W Hudson Fysh KBE, DFC, (the founder of QANTAS) and the brothers, Captain Sir Ross Smith KBE, MC, DFC, AFC., and Lieutenant Sir Keith Smith KBE.\n\nText and images reproduced with the kind permission of the Australian War Memorial.

It consisted of one Lady Superintendent and twenty-four nurses. The first actual service of nurses with Australian troops was during the Boer War (1898-1903).\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, the Australian Government raised the first Australian Imperial Force for overseas service. The nurses to staff the medical units, which formed an integral part of the AIF, were recruited from the Australian Army Nursing Service Reserve and from the civil nursing profession.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573238/cpbamcwsnhfuzgkrk688.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Many are wearing their life jackets over their long nurses uniforms. The Karoolawas initially used as a troop transport, but on arrival at Southampton, England, she was converted to a hospital ship, with accommodation for approximately 460 patients. As a hospital ship she made numerous voyages between England and Australia.**\n\nSenior officers were more inclined to have trained male soldiers in preference to female nurses. Major General Howse, Director of Medical Services, has been quoted as saying that ‘the female nurse — as a substitute for the fully trained male nursing orderly — did little toward the actual saving of life in war … although she might promote a more rapid and complete recovery’. General Howse was speaking at a time when the contribution of the Nursing Service to the treatment of the wounded soldiers, at an early stage, had yet to be recognized by the Australian authorities.\n\nThe first draft of Sisters left Australia in September 1914 and throughout the war, the Nursing Service served wherever Australian troops were sent. A number were also sent to British units in various theatres of war.\n\nAustralian nurses served in places such as Vladivostok, Burma, India, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France and England. The record of service for these Sisters is outstanding, and one which set a very high standard for all who were to follow. The statistics are noteworthy:\n\n2139 served overseas\n\n423 served in Australia\n\n25 died\n\n388 were decorated\n\n(Seven Military Medals were awarded to Australian Nurses for their courage under fire.)\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573280/fa5ezfgvhrobk1gxn9s8.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

I passed the cook running for an adjacent paddock, swearing hard and complaining that the bombs had put his fire out.</p>\n\nRunning on, she suddenly fell headlong into a bomb crater …\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I shall never forget the awful climb on hands and feet out of that hole that was about five feet [1.5 metres] deep with greasy clay and blood (although I did not know then that it was blood).</p>\n\nShe raced back to the tent and was shortly joined by the badly shaken Padre, who went off to get help — after urging her to take cover. She ignored the advice and again tried to get into the tent. Grabbing hold of a handle under the fly, she tried to drag a stretcher free. The patient was dead, and the splintered handle came away in her hand, throwing her backwards into the crater again.\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I cannot remember what came next, or what I did, except that I kept calling for the orderly to help me and thought he was funking, but the poor boy had been blown to bits. Somebody got the tent up, and when I got to the delirious pneumonia patient, he was crouched on the ground at the back of the stretcher. He took no notice of me when I asked him to return to bed, so I leaned across the stretcher and put one arm around and tried to lift him in. I had my right arm under a leg, which I thought was his, but when I lifted I found to my horror that it was a loose leg with a boot and a puttee on it. It was one of the orderly’s legs which had been blown off and had landed on the patient’s bed. The next day they found the trunk [torso] about 20 yards [18 metres] away.</p>\n\nTo put into some perspective the workloads and consequent stresses these nurses endured, consider:\n\n- During the First World War, a one thousand-bed hospital in Cairo — completely under tentage, without any floor covering — was staffed by one matron, 15 Sisters and 30 staff nurses.\n- In 1917, in France, one of the hospitals had to be extended to 2000 beds during a ‘heavy rush’.\n\nActing under such adverse conditions, these women proved themselves to be of awesome dedication.\n\nSister Alice Ross-King, ARRC, MM\n\n**from Just Soldiers by Darryl Kelly**\n\nOne such lady who was truly worthy of the title ‘front-line angel’ was Alice Appleford (nee Ross-King).\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573481/rmxolujpkwnhtomlxrwe.png)\n\n**Sister Alice Ross-King ARRC, MM.

Alice, along with a number of other nurses, was detached to the nearby city of Suez, where they were tasked to prepare suitable buildings to be used as clearing stations for Gallipoli casualties.5\n\nTheir worst fears were realised when, in late April 1915, the first of the wounded from the Gallipoli beachhead reached the wards. Alice and the other dedicated nursing staff worked around the clock, tending to their patients and fighting overwhelming odds to improve the survival prospects of many of the most seriously wounded. Sometimes they were successful. Other times they had to face the heartbreaking reality that their best efforts had failed. To those in their care they were truly front-line angels.\n\nIt was decided that some of the more gravely wounded would be returned to Australia — to make room for others of the increasing number of casualties. As the wounded would need nursing care during their voyage home, it was necessary for some of the nurses to accompany them to provide ongoing treatment during the trip. Sister Ross-King was amongst those chosen to return to Australia.1\n\nAlice was aware that a shortage of nursing staff at home might jeopardise her chances of returning to the front. Immediately after she landed in Australia, she sought to secure orders to be sent back to Egypt. She enjoyed a short leave with her mother before again bidding her a tearful good-bye.\n\nIn April 1916, Sister Ross-King helped establish 1AGH in France.5 The hospital was based in Rouen and the medical staff quickly prepared themselves for the onslaught of casualties from the ‘real’ war. They didn’t have to wait long — actions at Fromelles in the north and Pozieres on the Somme kept the hard-pressed nurses working around the clock.\n\nRoss-King remained at 1AGH Rouen for the duration of the Somme offensive then joined the 10th Stationary Hospital at St Omer in the north of France. In July 1917, Alice was moved forward to the 2nd Australian Casualty Clearing Station which was situated close to the battlefront near Trois Arbres.5\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573630/no9skjaqulzbzwtas7l1.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Most of the patients treated were wounded in the fighting of the Third Battle of Ypres.**\n\nOne night — only five days after her arrival — Alice was making her way back to her tent at the end of her shift. As she followed a young orderly along the duckboards, she heard the high-pitched sound of approaching aircraft. Staring skyward, she could see the grey outline of the planes and as they came closer she could distinguish the bold crosses on the wings.\n\nShe knew that the hospital was clearly marked with large red crosses but, despite this, the German pilots seemed hell-bent on attacking. She heard the whistle of falling bombs just before one of the missiles exploded directly in front of her, knocking her to the ground. Regaining her senses, Alice looked around for the orderly but could not see him. Realising the enormity of the situation, she rushed back to her patients.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573672/ij6bgd699ns9fsd6tm5d.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

St. Omer, France, 2nd Casualty Clearing Station tent lines, 12 kilometres from the town.**\n\nThe deadly projectiles were now bursting amid the buildings and tents. As she ran to the wards, she found what was left of the pneumonia ward tent. The extract in her diary reads:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Though I shouted, nobody answered me or I could hear nothing for the roar of the planes and artillery. I seemed to be the only living thing about.</p>\n\nDuring the ensuing hours, Alice’s actions were inspirational. Little did she know that her work on that terrible night would result in her being awarded the Military Medal, ‘for great coolness and devotion to duty’.6\n\nBy now, the AIF was locked in the Third Battle of Ypres and the casualty clearing station was filled to capacity with wounded Diggers. The doctors and nurses worked tirelessly as the sheer volume of casualties and the severity of their wounds taxed the medical staff to their limits. Alice wrote:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The Last Post is being played nearly all day at the cemetery next door to the hospital. So many deaths … 5</p>\n\nIn November 1917, Alice returned to Rouen where she was promoted to Head Sister, 1AGH. Accompanied by a number of other sisters and nurses, Alice moved to an advanced dressing station just behind the front lines. The stream of incoming wounded seemed endless and the days were long and tiring. After one such shift, when they had finally gained the upper hand, the doctor said, ‘That’s the lot for now, Sister. Why don’t you get some sleep while you can?’\n\nAs she made her way back to her tent, she heard the feeble, anguished moans of wounded men. She searched until she found the source—53 badly wounded German prisoners who had been all but forgotten for the past three days. ‘Doctor! Doctor! Come quickly!’ she called frantically.\n\nAlice’s diary entry summed up the situation that confronted her:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I shall never forget the cries that greeted me. They had gone without food or water … everyone on our staff was dead beat but I got the doctor to come and fix them up. We did forty patients in 45 minutes (the other 13 had died). No waiting for chloroform … amputations and all, and onto the train an hour and a half after I had found them.</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573757/jsydfpg1lsbpt90sbfsl.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Major A R Appleford, ARRC, MM, Assistant Controller, Australian Army Medical Women’s Service.**\n\nAlice was twice Mentioned in Despatches and she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, 2nd Class, in the King’s Birthday Honours of 1918.6\n\nWith the cessation of hostilities following the Armistice, Alice returned to England. In January 1919 she boarded a troopship bound for home. It was during the voyage that she met her future husband, Dr Sydney Appleford. The pair married later that year and settled in rural Victoria.\n\nWith the onset of the Second World War, Alice Appleford took on the task of training members of the Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs) — medically trained but not fully qualified nurses who worked in convalescent hospitals, on hospital ships and in the blood bank, as well as on the home front.\n\nIn 1949, Alice was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for her considerable efforts in support of the Red Cross and Service charities.5\n\nAn extract of the citation sums up this amazing woman:\n\nNo-one who came in contact with Major Appleford could fail to recognise her as a leader of women. Her sense of duty, her sterling solidity of character, her humility, sincerity and kindliness of heart set for others a very high example.\n\nAlice Appleford died on 17 August 1968, but her memory lives on in the Alice Appleford Memorial Award, which is presented annually to an outstanding member of the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps.\n\n1.

Your predecessors in Premier Ryan and Leader of the Opposition James Tomlie were both present at the formation of the Committee on 10th of January 1916, and your presence together today symbolises the fidelity of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee to the non-partisan vision of its founders.\n\nI also acknowledge senior members of our service organisations here in Queensland.\n\nEvery day around our State, new organisations are born, clustered around an idea or worthy goal.\n\nFew survive for a decade, even fewer to mark their centenary.\n\nTo last, organisations must speak to the enduring values that bind us together.\n\nAt that first meeting, 100 years ago, which led to the formation of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, then Governor, Major the Honourable Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, submitted the following motion:\n\n“That the heroic conduct of our gallant Queensland troops during the present war, and especially on that ever-memorable occasion of the landing at Gallipoli on April 25 last, has earned for them undying fame, and deserves the fullest recognition by the people of this country, whose rights and liberties they have been bravely defending.”\n\nHis words seem as strong and enduring as the values that today we call the Spirit of Anzac; of courage, fortitude and looking out for your mates; of honour and service before self.\n\nGovernor Goold-Adams was a veteran of the Boer War who understood the pain of the families of the dead and the missing.\n\n100 years ago he chose to be part of the great project of remembrance.\n\nIt is a project that will forever remain unfinished, and whose work is entrusted to us today.\n\nQueenslanders have never forgotten the bravery and sacrifice of the men who stepped ashore in the cold dawn at Gallipoli, more than a century ago.\n\nIt has been the noble work of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee to shape our experience of the anniversary of that great and terrible day, through the Second World War, through other wars and conflicts, and through the passing of the World War One veterans and their wives.\n\nI am very proud to be the Patron of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, taking my place in the proud succession of Governors who have performed this service to our State.\n\nI am grateful to the members of the Executive Committee and their predecessors, to all the Pastoral, Civic, Civil, Welfare, Service and Ex-Service Organisations who provide representation, and to everyone who serves the Committee’s great purpose.\n\nAs we pause to acknowledge the achievement of 100 years of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, as your Patron I rededicate myself to working with you ensure that Anzac Day remains a day of gratitude and reflection for all Australians, for another 100 years.\n\nThank you.

For the last four years of the war Australia’s main war effort had been in the Pacific, fighting the Japanese. Nearly 30,000 Australians had died, many of those as prisoners of the Japanese. Thousands more were damaged physically and mentally as a result of that POW experience. When Japan surrendered to end the war, there were strong feelings among most Australians against that nation.\n\nIt was agreed by the Allies that the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, India and New Zealand would each provide a contingent in the occupation of Japan. The force was to be known as the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Lieutenant General J. Northcott, an Australian, was appointed as Commander-In-Chief. Australia supplied Army, Navy and Air Force personnel and equipment as part of the multi-nation force.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543213060/flftoyyrmvm6rejgk9vs.png)\n\nPart of the task facing the Australian and other service men and women sent to Japan was also to help the war-torn Japanese nation to rebuild and recover. Japanese cities had been bombed savagely and millions of its soldiers and civilians had died. Its economy was shattered and it was facing the complete destruction of its traditional way of life and government. The Japanese people were stunned by the suddenness of their defeat. In the cities, crude shelters were being erected in the bombed areas.  There were few shops or markets, and the population was still striving to provide itself with two necessities of life - shelter and food.\n\nWhen war broke out in Korea in 1950, many of the BCOF troops were the first to be sent there as part of the United Nations force.\n\nThe Occupation of Japan lasted from 13 February 1946 through to the end of 1951 when the San Francisco Treaty was signed. In the British Commonwealth assigned occupation areas the burden fell to the Australians from the end of 1948. It was the Australian Government's policy to maintain a force in Japan as long as the occupation lasted.\n\nMany veterans felt that they did not receive recognition for their service in BCOF. It was not until 1994 that a medal commemorating their service was authorised.",

During March 1946, the 34th Brigade commenced duties such as disarmament and disposals, security and surveillance, patrolling and searching, supervision of elections and police, locating military equipment, plant, narcotics and black market raids. Each battalion took its turn, with other countries, for garrison and guard duties on the Emperor's Palace in Tokyo. Members of the British Commonwealth Base Force engineers, ordnance, signals and medical all played their part in bomb disposal, bridge and barracks buildings, telecommunications, looking after the sick, transport and running BCOF.\n\nWhen the army troops landed the weather was shocking, the barracks had no windows, heating or lighting, but the Australians, well known for scrounging, soon were comfortable.

There was also a small naval force known as HMAS Commonwealth based at Kure with the duties of clearance of jetties, docks, wrecks, destruction of Japanese vessels, adjustment and running of dock facilities. A large number of Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force service women saw service in hospitals in Japan, and Australians \n\n(Adapted from Shinbun Issue 41)\n\n## Australian families\n\nIn December 1946, Cabinet approved the despatch of families of Australian servicemen to Japan when housing and medical facilities became available. The first group of families reached Japan on 1 June 1947.\n\nThe main family housing area was located on a disused Japanese air strip fronting the Inland Sea at Hiroshima, in the 34th Australian Infantry Brigade area. Here a considerable township grew up with bungalows and two- or four-apartment dwellings. Chapels, a school, shop and cinema were included in the development. Japanese contractors carried out the work and furniture was obtained from Japanese sources. To give variety, different types of houses were interspersed, and the changing shades of pastel colouring of plaster walls and roofs made a cheerful and bright picture. My wife, on being consulted regarding the future name of the area, immediately asked what was the Japanese for ‘Rainbow Village’. Niji Mura it therefore became and still remains.\n\n(Adapted from Major General R. W. L. Hopkins. *History of the Australian Occupation in Japan, 1946-50*, page 109, in Royal Australian Historical Society Proceedings, Vol 40 No 2, 1954)\n\n## Accommodation 1947\n\nAs the force settled down in permanent locations, it became possible to provide amenities on a scale more suitable for the conditions. It must be remembered that our troops were forbidden to fraternise or enter Japanese houses, hotels or places of entertainment, and were voluntarily doing a job thousands of miles from home.\n\nThis move, together with the provision of sports grounds, a club and theatre, and the sight of new buildings under construction made a tremendous difference to the outlook of all ranks. Units developed a keenness and smartness, and set an example that was outstanding in any company.\n\n(Adapted from Shinbun Issue 36)\n\n## Leave\n\nLeave in Japan was the next most important thing for the welfare of the troops. Steadily, hotels were taken over to give BCOF troops access to historical and cultural places at Kobe, Kyoto, at Nikko with its temples and winter sport; at Kawana with its golf, riding and sea air; and in Tokyo. Even so, the demand far exceeded the supply, and many of those who returned early to Australia saw little of the famous resorts and lovely countryside of Japan.\n\n(Adapted from Major General R. W. L. Hopkins, History of the Australian Occupation in Japan, 1946-50, page 108-109)\n\n## Secret societies\n\nWhen the Emperor told his people to ‘bear the unbearable’ in August 1945, there were still some who refused to accept his direction. Fortunately, the majority of Japanese, having endured war since 1931, followed the old Japanese proverb ‘the willow branch but bends beneath the snow’ and accepted the foreign occupation for the moment, with thoughts for the future.\n\nHowever, out there were fanatics looking for victims. Sergeant Tom Kerr, a member of my unit, was found dead in a street, poisoned.\n\n(Adapted from Shinbun Issue 40)\n\n## Civilian crime\n\nThere were fewer than 1,000 civilian arrests in the Australian area in three years. By far the greater majority of the cases related to illegal possession and the taking and disposing of Occupation Force goods. Many of the cases were petty offences. There was a remarkable lack of crimes of violence against the personnel of the Occupation Force throughout the whole of Japan.\n\n(Adapted from Major General R. W. L. Hopkins, History of the Australian Occupation in Japan, 1946-50, page 112)\n\n## How were Japanese war brides received in Australia?\n\nWhen Gordon Parker married a Japanese girl, ‘Cherry’, early in the occupation of Japan, he stirred up considerable concern amongst the army and Australian politicians.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543213931/gt5qxq0hyoomz36it6og.png)\n\nNot long after Gordon and Cherry's marriage, other BCOF members applied, thereby forcing the Australian Government to develop a policy with regard to foreign marriages. By 27 March 1952, the Australian government had authorised the admission of Japanese wives of Australian servicemen and ex-servicemen into Australia, provided they were approved by the Australian Embassy in Japan.\n\nKure Municipal Police screened all girls to ensure that they were not:\n\n- communists\n- prostitutes\n- holders of a criminal record\n- from a family with signs of hereditary insanity.\n\nIn addition they had to pass a thorough medical test that included a full x-ray and blood test. If tuberculosis or any other serious illness was present, they were denied access until totally fit.\n\nThe examination and investigation was considered more stringent than that required for any other migrant.\n\nThe average age of wives was 22, and only 49 of the 150 couples had, or were about to have, children. In 22 out of the 150 cases, both parents (of the bride) were dead. Of the remainder, the parents of only 14 objected to the marriage. Only in one case did the Japanese police request non-approval of the marriage, because the parents were strongly opposed to the marriage.\n\n*‘Whether Australia should ban the admission of Japanese wives is a matter for eventual discussion, but until that decision is made those wives who do come to Australia - lawfully and at the invitation of their Australian husbands - should be treated decently, with a special effort on the part of returned men to make them feel comfortable. If only to offset the inevitable hostility from that small section of the community who, in addition to not having travelled beyond their own shores, have a way of attacking any person who does not conform to their own pattern and way of life.’*\n\n(Adapted from Returned Services League, Mufti, December 1952.)",

          "content": "Not long after the end of World War Two, Korea was divided into two zones of occupation at the 38th Parallel. The southern zone was controlled by the American forces; the northern zone came under the influence of the Soviet Union. Unable to find a solution to the issue of re-unification, the UN decided to establish two separate nations - the Republic of South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea.\n\nThe United States, fearful of the spread of communism in Asia after the success of the Communist Revolution in China in 1949, maintained forces in South Korea to protect it against the Communist North.\n\nIn June 1950, North Korean forces invaded South Korea, pushing the latter's forces back to the Pusan perimeter. The United Nations decided to send a force to defend South Korea, composed of contingents from 15 nations including Australia, Britain, United States, Canada, Turkey, Greece, Colombia, New Zealand, The Philippines, France, The Netherlands, South Africa and Luxembourg, and medical units from Denmark, India, Italy, Norway and Sweden.\n\nAlthough the Korean War did not escalate into a world war, it proved to be a long and bloody war. Most of the burden for the war fell on the shoulders of the United States. When the North Koreans were all but defeated, the communist forces of China entered the fray in their defence, thus prolonging the war.\n\nWhy was Australia involved in the Korean War?\n\nThe nation was substantially in favour of Australian involvement. Many felt that Australia's security may be at risk if the communist aggression was not stopped in Korea. Australia was vulnerable because of its small manpower resources. The Australian Government's decision to enter the Korean war was fully supported by the major Opposition party, the Labor Party.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543214569/lszvhgdxvz1scdnrk8dl.png)\n\n**3RAR disembarking at Pusan port, Korea, 28 September 1950. (AWM 146879)**\n\nLike to copy this image?

(Bulletin, 1954) It was also very important for our Government to show its full support for the United Nations. ‘ ... It is indeed a momentous occasion, because for the first time in the history of this Parliament, we have been asked to support action by our Government in implementing the principles of the United Nations.’ (Mr P Spender, Minister for External Affairs).",

Many local Malays did not want their country to be a colony of Britain but they were not strong enough to remove the colonial power. This continued through to World War 2, when, in 1941, the Japanese invaded and defeated the British, and occupied the area, ‘liberating’ it from colonialism (but in fact imposing their own often brutal colonial rule).\n\nDuring this period the British trained and equipped many local Malays and Malay Chinese as guerrilla groups to fight the Japanese. The Chinese in particular hated the Japanese because of their invasion of and brutal behaviour in parts of China in the 1930s.\n\nAt the end of the war, the British wanted non-communist Malays to take control - but the Malay Chinese, many of whom were communists, wanted Malaya to be a communist country, so they started to fight the British.\n\n1957 population figures for Malaya:\n\n- Malays - 3.12 million\n- Chinese - 2.33 million\n- Indians - 0.69 million\n- Others - 0.12 million\n\n(Federation of Malaya Year Book 1959)\n\nThe Malay Communists had the potential support of many local Malay Chinese - who had been badly treated by the government, denied land rights, and were economically very poorly off after the war. They sometimes helped, but rarely hindered, the active Malay Communists.\n\nOn 16 June 1948 three British planters were executed by communist terrorists (CTs) and a State of Emergency was declared by the British government.\n\nOne early tactic was to move many Malays in fringe areas to new villages, to keep them away from the Malay Chinese communist influence. This was initially resented, although it improved their living conditions eventually.\n\nFrom 1951, the British started a campaign to ‘win the hearts and minds’ of the Malays, as well as defeating the CT guerrillas. The tactic was to isolate the guerrillas from community support, and drive them into the jungle where existence was difficult. Patrolling would keep them on the move, and break up their concentration of strength, wear them down, and destroy their hidden supply and ammunition caches. Aerial bombing would also be a part of this continual harassment.\n\nThe Malay and British governments asked Australia for military support. The Australian government was keen to help; Communism seemed to be on the spread in Asia; support would stabilise a friendly government in the region; it would also maintain a traditional commitment to Britain; it would also show that Australia was a good ally ready to help its South East Asian Treaty Organisation allies. It also suited Australia to meet any potential enemy in other countries: Prime Minister Menzies said in 1955, ‘...if there is to be war for our existence it should be carried on as far from our shores as possible’.\n\nBy 1955, when Australian troops arrived in Malaya, the war against the CTs was being won, but needed a long and wearying ‘cleaning up’ process - in which the Australians took part.",

There were several fatalities among men - and these are not on the Roll of Honour, and I think they should be. We'll keep fighting to get them on one day.\n\nWe were always busy - there were regular four-hourly watches, and then there was plenty of maintenance and cleaning jobs to carry out during other times, training exercises with other ships, and such. So it could have been boring, but we were always busy.\n\nWe did our bit - basically blockading the area, keeping potential enemy supplies by sea out of the picture, and stopping potential disruption of the busy commercial sea lanes by mines. We were unnoticed, but successful.\n\n## Colin Bannister - 3RAR\n\n**Problems with mites and mosquitoes**\n\nMalaria was the main concern. ... On patrol in the jungle it was sleeves down all the time and mosquito lotion sloshed on exposed skin all the time. Mosquito nets for sleeping were a necessity except on patrol where they were not only bulky but cumbersome to get out of in a hurry in the dark.\n\nMites were the carriers of unpleasant things like typhus so anti-mite fluid ... had to be rubbed into the seam of shirts and trousers and then reapplied periodically to counter the fluid's dilution through rain, sweat and washing.\n\n**The enemy (CTs)**\n\nThe CT (Communist Terrorist) soldier was well used to living in the jungle. ... Food and other supplies came from the jungle gardens of the fringe squatters and surrounding kampongs (villages). He had jungle workshops to repair his weapons and equipment, jungle hospitals for first aid treatment, a network of agents and sympathisers in village, town and city, and a cowed rural population to coerce for food, money, information and sanctuary. His discipline, fieldcraft, navigation and minor tactics were good and his weapon handling adequate. He relied on surprise in ‘hit and run’ tactics such as the ambush and, (initially) could be ruthlessly cruel in murdering, mutilating or kidnapping people of influence and their families - village headmen, teachers, local government officials.\n\n**Waiting in ambush**\n\nSquirming to get comfortable, there's time to become familiar again with the local vegetation as darkness descends and the mosquitoes try to penetrate your clothes and the lotion on your skin. After a while legs get numb, arms ache and the mind wanders. Suddenly there's a noise and the skin tingles and the heart thumps but no shadowy figure comes into view and slowly you relax. Animals were often the cause of spring or premature ambushes, particularly at night when pigs, monkeys or deer could blunder into the site.\n\n**Returning from patrol**\n\nBut when they were home sweet home, with loving wives to greet the returning warriors who by this time were rather hot, sweaty and smelly warriors. Ah, the bliss of climbing out of uniform whose starched pristineness had deteriorated into black sweat patches and creases, to shower, change, have a drink and think about what to do for the next few days. The (servants) would whisk away the soiled clothes and confer with ‘Mem’ about dinner that night while I would sit back in sheer content.\n\n(Colin Bannister, An Inch of Bravery. 3RAR in the Malayan Emergency 1957-59. Directorate of Army Public Affairs, Canberra, 1994. p38, 50, 76, 80)\n\n## Spud Spurgeon - 1 Squadron, RAAF\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543307131/r6nf38bgd4vdwx0vkf2i.png)\n\nI was a pilot in No 1 Squadron, flying Lincoln Bombers. I was 35 in 1956.\n\nIt was a funny war for us. It was safe in that there was no opposition from the air or the ground, but it was very hard to see let alone hit a target. ‘Going hunting’, we called it. The two or two and a half hour flights could get pretty difficult, but that was because of the weather - flying in a tropical storm can be very scary.\n\nWe would get the word that there was a target, then a marker aircraft would drop smoke, and we would try to hit the area. Well, we never were told the result of our raids. I don't suppose anybody really knew - it was usually too hard for anyone to get into the jungle to see what had happened. We know we hit an elephant once, and destroyed plenty of trees, but I don't know what else we might have hit.\n\nBut I'm sure we had an impact - we kept the CTs guessing and scared and isolated, and that was our main task, not to kill them.",

          "content": "The Indonesian Confrontation (or Konfrontasi in Indonesian) was a small undeclared war fought from 1962 - 1966 through which President Sukarno of Indonesia tried to destroy the newly created nation of Malaysia.\n\nSukarno argued that the new nation was in fact just a way of maintaining British colonial influence in the area.\n\nIndonesia had recently gained control of West Irian (formerly West New Guinea) from the Dutch, giving it a shared border with Australia in Australian-controlled Papua-New Guinea. Australia did not want any armed conflict with Indonesia on its border, but it also wanted a strong, united, anti-communist Malaysia.\n\nBut when Malaysia was created, Indonesia declared its opposition and hostility to it.\n\nIndonesian President Sukarno was a militaristic, tough, nationalist, who was also trying to balance two great powers in his nation - the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and the Army. He hoped that his opposition to Malaysia would keep both of them together and in support of him.\n\nDuring 1963 the Indonesians sent small parties of regular and irregular soldiers to wage terrorist and propaganda actions in the former British areas of Borneo (Sarawak and Sabah). In 1964 they stepped up their actions to include raids on the Malaysian peninsula.\n\nThe Australian government was reluctant to commit its troops to actions against Indonesian soldiers, but finally decided to do so when repeatedly asked by the Malaysian government.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543307499/fbunb6xxet4dttgtbu1r.png)\n\nThe main focus of Australian attention was in the Malaysian areas of Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak). Fighting was in difficult terrain and in an oppressive jungle climate. The troops were sited along the border to protect population centres from enemy attacks. But they also made frequent though secret incursions into Indonesian territory, forcing the Indonesians to defend themselves rather than be an attacking force.\n\n3 RAR had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and suffered two mine casualties in 1965. In 1966 they were replaced by 4 RAR, which had a quieter time. In addition, two SAS squadrons, artillery batteries, engineers and RAN ships were involved.\n\n23 Australians were killed, seven of these on operations, and 108 wounded.\n\nThere was very little press coverage in Australia at the time, because of the sensitivity of the operations and the cross-border activities. The Australian troops were all sworn to secrecy about having entered Indonesian territory, and it was not until 1996 that the ‘invasion’ was publicly admitted.\n\nIn 1965 Indonesian army leaders staged a coup against Sukarno, and massacred thousands of PKI members. Once firmly in command, they stopped the policy of Konfrontasi, and recognised the new nation of Malaysia in 1966.",

          "content": "## Peter Schuman on leading his four man SAS patrol in Borneo\n\nIt was absolutely horrendous. ... The maps were absolutely atrocious. Sometimes half the maps you had were just white with ‘No reliable data because of cloud cover all year round’. ... I travelled through moss forests, saw packs of orang-outangs in the wild and wild deer. It was just hard slogging - day after day of patrolling. That was what I called the ‘loneliness time’. That was the first time that I was a million miles away from home, all by myself, in command - it was bloody lonely, it really was.\n\nWinning hearts and minds\nInitially we did ‘hearts and minds’ where we were located in small areas that included one or two kampongs (villages) and our medics looked after their health. We tried to get information out of them, learnt their language, and learnt their customs. We lived away from them but each day we would go in. We gave them kerosene, and caught food with them using explosives. We played cricket ... and footy with them. We learnt more about living in the jungle ourselves, learnt more about them and gained a lot of information on the areas.\n\n(Peter Schuman in Gary McKay, Sleeping with your ears open. On patrol with the Australian SAS. Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 1999, p53,55)\n\n## Ian Conaghan remembers his service\n\nLeeches were horrendous, unbelievable. I remember getting one in the groin, because with leeches you don't know you've had them and the stinging only starts at the very end before they drop off. ... My daks were not only soaking wet with water, but were soaking wet with blood ... My patrol commander ... was bitten on the arm by a scorpion, and honestly within a few hours you would swear that someone had slipped a football under his skin. It was huge!\n\nThere were lots and lots of snakes, orang-outangs, lots of monkeys. Once I came across tiger spoor and you could actually smell the tiger, but we never actually saw one. ... The animals were a problem but not because of any physical threat to us, but because if we encroached on their territory they would make a lot of noise and it was just like having a jungle warning system. Anybody in the area would know that something had disturbed these guys.\n\n(Ian Conaghan in Gary McKay, Sleeping with your ears open. On patrol with the Australian SAS. Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 1999, p71-2)\n\n## Max Cannon remembers his service\n\nI was a rifleman with 3RAR 1965 in Borneo.\n\nOur main role on patrols was ambushing, and keeping the enemy on the move. Most ambushes didn't catch anyone. It was a very long and tedious process. We knew that we were going into Indonesian territory, but had to keep it hush hush.\n\nConditions were very hilly, very hot and humid. Conditions differed. If we went through a recovering rice paddy, there would be thick growth underfoot, that you would have to hack through foot by foot, under a boiling sun. At other times you would be going through this clear area or even moss ground, while above would be this unbroken jungle canopy. When it rained, you would hear the rain hitting the canopy, but it took a long time to come dripping through. In other areas it might be swampy, up to your chest in water, and slipping on the slimy bottom.\n\nWe carried 5 days rations and ammo, easy 75-85 pound loads.\n\nWe had dehydrated ration packs - but it was often hard to get the water to add to them to cook. Clothes didn't last long - canvas boots with rubber soles were quiet, but would wear out very quickly.\n\nFew combat situations, and few combat casualties. The most damage was done by diseases - some got malaria, but that was pretty much under control. The worst was scrub typhus, passed on by a bite from a mite. It brought you out in a terrible, delirious fever, that burned you up, caused terrible cramps and such. It took several weeks to get over it. The other great problem was water - it was usually contaminated, and you would get leptospirosis. To kill the germs you had to add chlorine tablets - well that did wonders for the taste. We'd try to find fast running water and drink that, and take the risk.\n\nSome of the enemy were regulars, and they were well-trained troops. Some were irregulars, and were not well equipped and not great soldiers.\n\nWe also did a lot of observing over the border by large telescope, and a lot of ‘hearts and minds’ stuff. The locals were always friendly. You would provide them with escorts, medical help, building a school house, playing with the kids - that sort of thing.\n\nWe got a few weeks off occasionally, and that was good. But most of the time it was out on patrol, no contacts or anything, back to camp for a few days, then out on patrol again, over and over.\n\nWe were a very professional lot - good, experienced men. You felt safe and at home with them.",

          "title": "Vietnam War - Overview",
          "content": "The Vietnam War arose out of more than a century of foreigners’ occupation of Vietnam. It was a war for Vietnamese independence, but also a civil war between two competing philosophies.\n\nVietnam has always been subject to threats and invasion from its large neighbours - particularly China. In the eighteenth century a new threat emerged - the French invaded the area, called Annam then, and established control. They used the land as their colony, and created a strong French influence, though one which did not suppress Vietnamese desires for independence.\n\nIn the Second World War the Japanese invaded, and Vietnamese nationalists fought beside French troops to defeat the Japanese. After the victory over the Japanese, the Vietnamese expected to gain their independence - but the French remained as colonial masters. Many Vietnamese troops now turned to fighting the French.\n\nIn 1954 the French were defeated in the north at Dien Bien Phu, but in the south, Vietnamese leaders did not want to be part of the pro-Communist system being set up by the north. The country was divided along the 17th parallel of latitude, with the south being supported by the United States, and the north by Russia and China. The north began to send troops into to the south, supported by southerners sympathetic to their cause.\n\nThe main reason for the United States’ involvement was a fear that communism would spread throughout Asia. China had become communist in 1949, and the Korean War of the 1950s had seemed to show the spreading power and influence and threat of communism. The Australian government shared this view, and was ready to support the United States in South Vietnam.\n\nThe United States began sending larger and larger numbers of troops to South Vietnam. Australian soldiers were in South Vietnam as advisers from 1962. In 1965 Prime Minister Menzies, in an attempt to tie the United States to defence of Australia against any threat from Indonesia, announced that Australia would send combat troops. This included conscripted soldiers, National Servicemen, after 1966. These were chosen by a ballot of all 20 year old males, though only a small proportion of all eligible men were called up.\n\nMost Australian Army operational units served in South Vietnam during the war. They served mainly in the Phuoc Tuy province of Vietnam - at the Nui Dat base and at the logistics base at Vung Tau. Many officers and warrant officers served with distinction in South Vietnamese Army units as part of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV). The normal tour of duty was one year with complete unit replacement where appropriate, otherwise the unit remained in situ and only the personnel changed.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy commitment included: destroyers providing Naval Gunfire Support attached to the US Seventh Fleet; a Clearance Diving Team assisting in harbour defence; aircrew and support staff serving with the US Army's 135th Assault Helicopter Company; helicopter pilots serving with 9 Squadron RAAF; logistic support being provided by HMAS Sydney (known colloquially as the \"Vung Tau Ferry\") and MVs Jeparit and Boonaroo.\n\nAmong the Royal Australian Air Force commitments were: 2 Squadron (flying Canberra bombers) based at Phan Rang; 9 Squadron, providing transport and fire support to the 1st Australian Task Force from its base at Vung Tau; 35 Squadron, providing transport support with its Caribou aircraft; aircrew and various specialists serving with US Air Force units.\n\nFrom mid 1966 the main task of the Australians was to secure Phuoc Tuy province in which they were based. This involved fighting the North Vietnam Regular Army soldiers based there, as well as the local Viet Cong guerrillas, and denying them food, supplies and safe places. There was also a significant commitment to improving infrastructure in the province, with many Australian soldiers being employed on road and bridge construction, among other projects.\n\nIn 1967 the Australian commitment reached its peak at about 8,300 personnel in Vietnam at the one time. In 1970 withdrawals began, and by the end of 1972, the troops had virtually all been withdrawn, with security of the Province being handed over to the South Vietnamese Army. In 1975, after the withdrawal of United States’ support, the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong guerrillas took Saigon, and ended the war with the reunification of Vietnam under Communist rule. About 57,000 Australians served at some time in Vietnam, with about 520 (different numbers are given by different authorities, depending on the criteria applied) dying as a result of the war.",

Above all it called heavily on the determination, professionalism and courage of the soldiers on the ground.\n\nThe Battle of Long Tan was costly for Australia. Eighteen young Australians -- the youngest was nineteen, the oldest was twenty-two -- lost their lives as a result of this battle. A further twenty-one soldiers were wounded.\n\nThe damage inflicted on the enemy was significant. Two hundred and sixty confirmed dead and evidence to suggest that several hundred wounded were carried from the battlefield.\n\nFor its ‘extraordinary heroism while engaged in military operations against an opposing armed force’ D Company was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by the President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nThe Long Tan Cross was conceived by the 6th Battalion Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) WO1 James \"Jimmy\" Cruickshank during the unit’s second tour of duty in 1969. It was constructed by the unit’s engineers, the Pioneer Platoon.\n\nOn the third anniversary of the battle, the Cross was raised at the site of the battle where it remained untouched while the Australians were stationed in the province. Today it is located in the military museum at Bien Hoa.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544171628/qmliyhcvclyatdaotg9a.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

This group, founded by veteran Paul Murphy, has undertaken tasks such as the provision of water filtering apparatus, an orphanage, microfinance programs, English language tutoring and most recently, a kindergarten. The AVVRG are a registered non government organisation (NGO) in Vietnam and have long been interested in, and been conducting memorial services at the Cross on occasions such as ANZAC Day and Long Tan Day.\n\nThroughout the last twenty years, growing numbers of Australian servicemen have been making the pilgrimage back to Vietnam. During this time, the Long Tan Cross has increasingly become a focal point for remembrance of mates, both dead and living, and the sacrifices made in service to our country. Because of the unofficial nature of this memorial, upkeep was difficult and various groups had at times expressed concern at the state of the area, despite the best efforts of expatriates to maintain the site.\n\nClearly, something needed to be done.\n\nThe Long Tan Cross Memorial Fund was founded in June 2000 to try to gain official status for and bring a greater degree of permanence to the Long Tan Cross. The committee comprised veterans of 6RAR, the Long Tan Veterans Association, the RSL, the AVVRG (both in Australia and Vietnam) and the Navy and Air Force.\n\nFundraising was commenced shortly afterwards with ex-service and veterans organisations targeted in a bid to raise $60000. In addition to the Cross renovations, it was considered appropriate to provide funding for some local road works to assist the local Vietnamese as well as improve access for visiting veterans.\n\nWhile funds were sought, the AVVRG, with assistance at times from the Australian Consulate, made approaches and submitted plans to the Baria Vung Tau Peoples Committee and the Union of Friendship. Being a Communist country, there were many committees and many meetings. The proposed road improvements became less of an issue to the locals as agreement regarding the Cross renovations began to emerge.\n\nIt was March 2002 when the Long Dat Peoples Committee called a meeting attended by members from adjoining wards, police departments, Foreign Affairs and the AVVRG. The Chairman declared that all were in agreement that work should proceed and presented a civil contractor who would do the work. A contract was duly produced and signed by Rod Burgess of AVVRG and a deposit paid.\n\nOn 15 April 2002, representatives of the AVVRG and the Australian Consulate were invited to a ceremony at the site where the formalities of official handover were conducted. On behalf of all Australians, MrRod Burgess accepted the beautifully restored memorial site and assured the Chairman of the Long Dat Peoples Committee that visitors to the site would observe the correct protocols.\n\nThe Committee asks that any persons contemplating a visit to the area observe the protocols listed below.\n\n- It must be remembered that Vietnam is a Communist country and that foreigners cannot change the rules. Even for locals, movement can be restricted.\n- In a nutshell, if you wish to visit the Long Tan Cross, you must have a permit. The fastest way of obtaining the correct documentation is to use a company like VUNG TAU TOURIST COMPANY (vtautour@hcm.vnn.vn). Telephone in country (064) 850110 or Fax (064) 856444. Arrangements can be made from Australia and confirmed prior to travel. This is a virtual door to door service and the company is reputable. There are other companies offering a similar service. The advantage of these tour companies is that they come with an English speaking guide and that generally 24 hours notice is sufficient time for them to arrange permits. Alternatively you can see the Union of Friendship in Vung Tau where a permit will cost about US$5.00 and take 5–7 days to arrange.\n- Groups should not be larger than twenty.\n- Medals are not appropriate in this environment and should not be worn.\n\nFurther information concerning the renovation project can be obtained from The Long Tan Cross Memorial Fund.

The task of this force was initially to enforce UN sponsored sanctions against Iraq.\n\nThe first Australian vessels committed, the frigates HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide, sailed from Sydney on 13 August 1990, followed shortly afterward by the replenishment tanker HMAS Success. Because her integral air defence capability was inadequate, HMAS Success was allocated eight soldiers equipped with the RBS70 anti-aircraft weapon system from the Australian Army's 16th Air Defence Regiment.\n\nOn arrival in the Gulf in early September 1990, the Australian element of the MNNF immediately commenced operations in the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz where the two frigates were involved, with allied forces, in the interception of vessels proceeding into the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541057283/qqf4zrhh8jb8pzdcsdic.jpg)\n\nOn 29 November 1990 the UN, in the face of Iraq's unyielding attitude, passed Resolution 678 which gave authority to member states \"to use all necessary means\" against Iraq unless it withdrew from Kuwait by 15 January 1991.\n\nFor the next phase of the operation the three RAN vessels in the MNNF were replaced, in early December 1990, by the destroyer HMAS Brisbane, the frigate HMAS Sydney and the largest ship in the RAN's fleet, the 40,870 tonne replenishment ship HMAS Westralia. The Australian vessels entered the Persian Gulf as part of the largest fleet of warships since World War 2. Deployment in the Gulf was necessary to support the huge allied ground force now assembling in Saudi Arabia. Brisbane and Sydney were employed as part of the fleet's anti-air warfare screen.\n\nOperation Desert Storm, the allied operation designed to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait, started its offensive phase early in the morning of 17 January 1991 with massive air attacks on selected targets.\n\nOn 25 January 1991 HMAS Success departed for Australia; she was replaced by HMAS Westralia on 3 February. A RAN Clearance Diving Team arrived in the operational area on 30 January 1991 and was employed in preparation for a planned amphibious assault on the beaches of Kuwait. It subsequently cleared mines from ports and the open sea, and surveyed wrecked shipping.\n\nThe ground phase opened on 24 February 1991 and met with immediate and overwhelming success, defeating the Iraqi forces and forcing them to evacuate Kuwait by 28 February 1991.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Storm 40 members of the Australian Task Group Medical Support Element served in the US hospital ship USNS Comfort. In addition, a number of Australians of all three services served in the ground phase of the operation because the US and UK units to which they were posted were involved. Throughout Australia's involvement, the RAAF provided air transport support.\n\nAlthough hostilities had ceased with the capitulation of the Iraqi government, within Iraq turmoil erupted with a revolt of a dissident Kurdish minority. The Iraqis put down the revolt which resulted in a massive flight of Kurdish refugees. In a response to calls for help, Australia sent, on 16 May 1991, a 75-strong Army contingent of medical, dental, preventative medicine and field engineer teams.\n\nAustralia's involvement in the aftermath of the Gulf War continued until 1993, primarily in sanctions enforcement duty.\n\nThe above adapted from George Odger's Diggers - The Australian Army, Navy and Air Force in Eleven Wars from 6 June 1944 to 1994.",

          "content": "The island of Timor is approximately 800 km north-west of Darwin and about a fifth the size of Tasmania. Before the recent upheavals the population of East Timor was believed to be 800,000 - 78 percent Timorese, 2 percent Chinese and 20 percent Indonesian.\n\nThere are more than a dozen different ethnic groups on the island with their own languages and culture - the main group is Tetum.\n\nIn the 1500s Europeans established colonies in East Timor. The Portuguese and the Dutch were the main colonial powers. They established trade, mostly in sandalwood and coffee, took slaves, fought over territory and introduced European building, customs and religion. Portugal claimed East Timor in 1520 and the Dutch claimed West Timor in the 1640s. 92 percent of the population of East Timor is catholic, reflecting Christian missionary activity during their long period as a colony of Portugal.\n\nAfter WW2, the Dutch were forced out of West Timor which in 1949 became part of Indonesia. After having generally neglected the colony during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Portuguese abandoned East Timor in 1974. This led to civil war between rival local parties over who was to control the newly declared independent nation.\n\nIn September 1975 Indonesian troops began to cross the border into East Timor. Five journalists, two Australian, two British and one New Zealand, who reported on that infiltration were murdered by the Indonesians at Balibo. The Australian Government did not intervene.\n\nIn 1976 Indonesian President Suharto, proclaimed East Timor as the 27th province of Indonesia. The Australian Government was one of the very few to accept the legitimacy of the claim.\n\nAfter the Dili Massacre in 1991, Australia signed the Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia, guaranteeing that the countries would develop and share the rich oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea.\n\nIn 1993 the United Nations Human Rights Commission made the first of two reports criticising Indonesian abuses of human rights in East Timor\n\nIn 1996 the Nobel Peace prize was awarded to Jose Ramos Horta (a political activist, exiled for two decades during which he lobbied for world recognition of East Timor) and Bishop Carlos Belo (head of the Catholic church in East Timor) for their efforts to gain freedom and independence for East Timor. Horta is likely to be a key political leader in the new East Timor.",

          "content": "While the deeds of our original ANZAC heroes are long past, their spirit continues to live on through the more recent efforts of Australian troops in East Timor. The spirit of ANZAC is described by official war historian C.E.W. Bean as \"enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance\". These same qualities have also been attributed to our troops who served in East Timor.\n\nThe latest deployment was not the first time Australian soldiers have operated in East Timor. In December 1941 Japan entered World War 2 by invading Malaya, the Indonesian Archipelago and the south Pacific. Australia sent a small force, known as Sparrow Force, to defend the island of Timor. Despite a spirited campaign most of the Australians were forced to surrender. One group, however, were not captured and continued the fight. They relied heavily on support from the Timorese and a strong relationship seems to have developed. The indigenous people of East Timor were more supportive of the Australians than the West Timorese, a result of the different treatment they received from the Dutch and Portuguese. Later reinforcements had a less close relationship as the Japanese were intent on terrorising the local people to force them to stop helping the Australians. Fighting guerrilla warfare and dependent on local support, the Australians harassed the large Japanese force for nearly a year, until withdrawn. A small group of commandos remained active in the area for the rest of the war. As many as 60,000 East Timorese were killed during the conflict.\n\nOur most recent military involvement in East Timor began in 1999 when the East Timorese people were given the opportunity to vote on whether or not they wanted their independence from Indonesia. The world watched in horror at the violence unleashed when the people chose to become independent. Images and reports of fighting, looting, arson and even murder committed by pro-Indonesian militias and Indonesian troops were beamed around the world.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543476908/ndscxn0yaabqlp7mwfji.png)\n\nThe United Nations authorised an international force to enter the country. Its task was to provide protection and security to the local people. On 12 September 1999 Australian troops joined those from other nations to provide that security and allow the local people to begin rebuilding their lives and their new nation. The Australian-led International Force in East Timor comprised at its height 6300 troops.\n\nInterFET as it became known was headed by an Australian officer, Major General Peter Cosgrove. He was surprised to find there were still a number of people living in the region who remembered the Australian presence on the island during World War 2. General Cosgrove said he was pleased to be able to pay them back a little of the \"debt of honour\" that Australia owed the Timorese people for risking their lives to help Australian soldiers nearly sixty years ago.\n\n\"I have also discovered that the spirit of ANZAC lives on,\" he said. \"It is one that permeates all Australians and not just ones in uniform. It is the innate Australian quality of wishing everyone could get a fair go.\"\n\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard summed up the spirit of the Australian troops when he gave an address to the nation in September 1999 as they departed.\n\n\"Our soldiers go to East Timor as part of a great Australian military tradition which has never sought to impose the will of this country on others but only to defend what is right,\" he said.\n\nIn February 2000, after several months of helping to restore order and security, InterFET handed over much of its role to a United Nations force. The UN Transitional Administration East Timor, UNTAET, will continue to administer the territory for another two years.",

All Queensland schools were sent additional free copies of this book as part of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland's 1998 ANZAC Education Pack.</p>\n\nThe Western Front was the name the Germans gave to a series of trenches that ran 700 kilometres from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. To imagine this, think of a ditch deep enough to stand in zigzagging its way alongside the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Canberra. As at Gallipoli, machine-gun fire caused terrible casualties on the Western Front. Both sides had dug trenches, sometimes only metres apart, as their only protection from the murderous gun fire. But they were never safe from the explosive artillery shells that rained down on the front line soldiers every few seconds for days at a time. The British High Command needed troops urgently. So after the Gallipoli veterans were rested in Egypt, and had been strengthened by the ‘fair dinkums’ from Australia, they were sent to France to fight Germany. But Gallipoli was not the last time the ANZACs fought the Turks. The Light Horsemen were sent to the Middle East where they took part in several battles, the most spectacular of which was the mounted charge at Beersheeba.\n\n**NOTE** This symbol means that a detailed map is available. The maps have been prepared as Adobe Acrobat™ files, each ~200kb, and designed to print on two A4 pages.  \n\n**Life in the trenches**\n\nWhen the ANZACs arrived at the Western Front, the first thing they saw were the lines of wounded soldiers being taken to the rear. As they got closer, they could feel the earth shake, and hear the constant “crump crump” of artillery shells. The sound was loud enough to make their ears ring, and became their companion for the next three years.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400069/mgtbztzfdvuvuqjvn35n.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Boxes, cart wheels, wire and often the bodies of the dead and dying were strewn everywhere. These were the reserve trenches, far enough from the battle for soldiers to try to grab a little rest from all the madness in the front line.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400124/cnc4kqnl0tsoa8bagxzh.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM E862)**\n\nBut the ANZACs were soon to realise that the Germans were not the only enemy. The [winter of 1916](/snow-bound) was one of the worst on record. Living in these trenches was to cause nearly as many casualties as the fighting. The ANZACs had only two blankets each and had to sleep as close as possible to one another just to survive.\n\nImagine a winter so cold that water was carried to the soldiers as blocks of ice. Think how cold it must have been to wake after a few hours sleep only to find your eyelids frozen shut. And imagine if you had to keep a bottle of ink in your pocket, otherwise the ink would freeze. Imagine your feet swelling to three times their normal size because you had been standing for a week in water up to your knees. And think how cold it must have been when ice formed around the rim of a boiling cup of tea after you had carried it only 20 paces.\n\nThe ANZACs’ first major battle in Europe was near a town called Fromelles (From-el) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400561/xdcqvbowkxfpqdelldiz.pdf). For many it was also their last. The men received orders to attack the third line of the Germans’ trenches. They marched across no-man’s-land and quickly captured the first trench. From here, they fought their way forward and successfully captured the second trench. Despite the intense fire, they leapt from the second trench and went looking for the third and final trench where they could finally seek shelter. But there was no third trench. Meanwhile, the Germans had fought their way back into the first and second trenches, and by now the ANZACs were out in the open. They dived into bomb craters and filled sand bags with mud, anything to protect them from the deadly machine-gun fire. Here they lay until night fell, when they slowly tried to crawl back past the German trenches to the Australian line. The British High Command did not allow the rescue of wounded men in the open, in case the rescuers themselves should become wounded. The Australians disobeyed. They could not leave their mates stranded and calling for help. One officer walked across the battlefield and made a truce with the Germans. He even offered himself as a prisoner while his men tried to find all the Australian wounded. In the 27 hours after the Australians first attacked the German trenches, 5533 ANZACs had been killed or wounded. This was twice as many casualties as the landing at Gallipoli.\n\n**“A place so terrible...”**\n\nA section of the Western Front called the Somme, named after the river flowing through the area, was described by one ANZAC in August 1916 as “a place so terrible that a raving lunatic could never have imagined it”. In the middle of the Somme was a township called Pozières (Pozzy-air) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), which was built on one of the few high points in the area. Whoever held the ridge could see everything the enemy was doing. The British had tried to capture Pozières, and in one day alone suffered 60,000 casualties. The ANZACs were chosen to relieve the British, and were ordered to continue the attacks.\n\nThe Australians launched seven bloody attacks on the German defences over a six-week period. They concentrated on two main strong points, Gibraltar and the Windmill.\n\nOn 4 August 1916, the ANZACs finally captured the ridge line and what little was left of the town.\n\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400693/v2lhzg70r7tvummf9snr.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM E532)**\n\nOne out of every two ANZACs who fought here at the Somme became a casualty. In all they lost more than 22,000 men. Through their determination and courage, and in the most dreadful conditions, the ANZACs had proven themselves capable of doing the impossible. Unfortunately this was not the last time the British High Command would expect the impossible from the ANZACs.\n\nThe Australians who fought in the First World War never forgot the experience. The war changed their lives. But it also changed the lives of the many French and Belgian civilians who lived in the towns the ANZACs fought to save. In fact, they promised never to forget the role the ANZACs played in gaining their freedom.\n\nIn 1917, the French village of Bullecourt (Bull-cor) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400774/tikpwgipmsqj9bc6o2wb.pdf) sat in the middle of the Hindenburg Line – a mass of barbed wire joining concrete block houses and trenches. In some places the wire was 100 metres thick, and no Army had yet been able to break through it.\n\nOn the night of 11 April 1917 the Australians attacked the Germans in Bullecourt. The ANZACs had no artillery, and the tanks that were supposed to break through the wire broke down or bogged in the snow-covered ground. Major Percy Black, who was leading part of the attack, called to his men: “Come on boys, bugger the tanks!” and charged towards the wire. His men leapt through with him, and fought their way into the German trenches. They were the first soldiers to break through the Hindenburg line. Proudly they looked for Major Black. But he lay dead on the wire.\n\n**“N’oublions jamais l’Australie” (never forget Australia)**\n\nSo many ANZACs had been killed in the attack that only a handful of men were left alive to hold the trenches. The Germans realised this, and counter-attacked on three sides. Overwhelmed, the ANZACs were forced to withdraw. The only order given was to “fight it out like Australians”. The ANZACs returned three weeks later, and again captured the German trenches. For two weeks they survived vicious counter-attacks until the Germans finally gave in. When the smoke cleared from the battlefield, 10,000 Australians had been killed or wounded trying to save this small French village. In 1918, the Germans planned one final great offensive in an effort to win the war. At first the Allies were taken by surprise, and the Germans captured many towns and soon were within sight of the town of Amiens. The British High Command feared that if Amiens were captured, the war may be lost. The ANZACs were raced back from Belgium as ‘storm troops’ – special fighting soldiers who would be put into battle where they were needed most. At first, the ANZACs fought at Dernancourt (Dern-an-cor) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), a town on the road to Amiens, where 4000 Australians beat off an attack by 25,000 Germans.\n\nNext the Germans attacked the French village of Villers-Bretonneux (Bret-on-er) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), after first using poisonous [gas](/gassed-last-night) and artillery. When night fell, the ANZACs stormed from their trenches and counter-attacked. A British General, who himself had won a Victoria Cross for bravery, called the ANZACs’ attack “perhaps the greatest individual feat of the war”.\n\nThe ANZACs then had to enter the village and fight from house to house. Finally, Australian and French flags were raised over Villers-Bretonneux. The ANZACs stopped to bury their dead – 1200 Australians had been killed saving the village. It was not until they were putting the date on some makeshift crosses that they realised the date – it was ANZAC Day 1918, three years to the day since they had stormed ashore at Gallipoli.\n\nThe Australian flag is still flown at Villers-Bretonneux. It flies atop the Australian National Memorial, on which is listed the names of the 10,982 Australians killed in France who have no known grave. The French have called the main road through Villers-Bretonneux, Rue de Melbourne. The town has a restaurant called Restaurant le Kangarou, and the school, called Victoria College, was built from the donations of Victorian school children in the 1920s. Above every blackboard are the words “N’oublions jamais l’Australie” – never forget Australia.\n\nClick [here](/v-is-for-villers-bretonneux-bret-on-er) for a little more information about Villers-Bretonneux, including a picture of the War Memorial and cemetery\n\nIn May 1918, the ANZACs were finally commanded by one of their own. The officer chosen was General Sir John Monash. Monash had seen too many ANZACs killed, and was determined that the Australians were from now on were to be used properly.\n\nIn his first battle, at a place called le Hamel [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), Monash used aircraft, tanks and artillery to soften the enemy before he sent in the ANZACs. He also rehearsed the attack time and time again. Monash had planned it to last 90 minutes. After 93 minutes, his men had taken 1500 prisoners, caused 2000 German casualties and captured nearly 180 machine guns. But perhaps his best attack took place at Mont St Quentin [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541401071/uj3dvx0h8e97fjthkmhq.pdf), where the Germans held several thousand of their best men in reserve. The German General had decided that no one would be foolish enough to attack the hill, but just in case ordered his best-trained units to hold “to the death”. With less than a thousand men who had already been in combat for nearly three weeks, Monash planned his greatest attack. The ANZACs stormed the hill from three directions, and in two days had not only secured the hill, but had also captured 2500 prisoners. Victoria Crosses were awarded to another seven ANZACs for this action. It was to be the last great fight of their war.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In August the Desert Mounted Corps was formed, consisting of the ANZAC Mounted Division (1st, 2nd Light Horse and New Zealand Brigades), Australian Mounted Division (3rd, 4th Light Horse and 5th Yeomanry Brigades) and the Yeomanry Division.\n\nAfter playing a prominent part in the capture of Jerusalem in December, the Corps was withdrawn to rest. However, the German ‘Michael’ offensive in March 1918 caused many British troops, including most of the Yeomanry Division, to be redeployed to France. Nevertheless, the Corps defeated a determined attack in April by the German Asia Corps at Abu Telluk in the Jordan Valley. During September the Corps played an important part in the advance to Haifa and Semakh, and on 1 October entered Damascus. Turkey signed an armistice at the end of that month, by which time Corps units had reached Aleppo.\n\n*The above text is taken from the booklet The Australian Army - A Brief History.*\n\nMore Information:\n\n[Australian Light Horse - Historic Battles of WW1](http://alh-research.tripod.com/Light_Horse/index.blog/1881801/battles-where-australians-fought-18991920/)\n",

After Federation these colonial naval forces came under the control of the new Commonwealth government. Some ten years later the Royal Australian Navy came into being and the first fleet unit, led by the battlecruiser HMAS AUSTRALIA, arrived in Sydney Harbour. A year later this young navy was to undergo its baptism of fire.\n\nWith the outbreak of war the Royal Australian Navy’s first task was to protect Australia’s ports, shipping and trade routes. As part of securing Australia’s maritime frontiers the RAN took part in the first amphibious assault of the war when it played a major role in the capture of the German colonies in the Pacific. During this period the submarine the AE1 was lost on September 14 1914, off the coast of Rabaul, with all hands.\n\nAfter this operation the ships of the RAN began the vital role of convoy escort. It was whilst escorting a convoy that the light cruiser HMAS SYDNEY was detached to investigate the sighting of a strange warship. This ship turned out to be the German light cruiser EMDEN. In the ensuing battle SYDNEY destroyed the EMDEN and thus won the RAN’s first battle.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541405986/oufn52hu9gyr5mrdjmmj.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

It consisted of one Lady Superintendent and twenty four nurses. The first actual service of nurses was during the Boer War (1898-1903).\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541406875/whe3g81ah4zzbmtt9qfc.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM H07534)**\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, the Australian Government raised the first Australian Imperial Force for overseas service. The nurses to staff the medical units, which formed an integral part of the AIF, were recruited from the Australian Army Nursing Service Reserve and from the civil nursing profession.\n\nSenior Officers were more inclined to have trained male soldiers in preference to female nurses. Major General Howse (Director of Medical Services) has been quoted as saying that “the female nurse (as a substitute for the fully trained male nursing orderly) did little toward the actual saving of life in war... although she might promote a more rapid and complete recovery”. General Howse was speaking at a time when the contribution of the Nursing Service to the treatment of the wounded soldiers, at an early stage, had yet to be recognized by the Australian authorities.\n\nThe first draft of Sisters in the Australian Army Nursing Services (AANS) left Australia in September 1914; and throughout the war, the Nursing Service served wherever Australian troops were sent, and numerous other countries besides these. Most also served in British hospitals in various theatres of war.\n\nThey served in places such as Burma, India, The Persian Gulf, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France and England.\n\nThe record of service for these Sisters is a brilliant one, and one which set a very high standard for all who were to follow. The following statistics are noteworthy:\n\n- more than 2286 nurses served overseas\n- more than 423 served in Australia\n- 25 died\n- at least 388 were decorated (seven Military Medals were awarded to Australian Nurses for their courage under fire).\n\nAn example of one nurse's experience under fire is from Sister Kelly’s diary from a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front....\n\n“The noise was so terrific, and the concussion so great that I was thrown to the ground and had no idea where the damage was. I flew through the chest and abdo wards and called out: ‘are you alright boys?’ ‘don’t bother about us’ was the general cry.”\n\nAll the hospitals lights were out and there was a faint moon, but the sky overhead was full of searchlights and fragments from the bursting anti-aircraft artillery. She passed the cook running for an adjacent paddock, swearing hard and complaining that the bombs had put his fire out.\n\nRunning on, she suddenly fell headlong into a bomb crater...\n\n“I shall never forget the awful climb on hands and feet out of that hole that was about five feet deep with greasy clay and blood (although I did not know then that it was blood). A bomb had fallen directly alongside the pneumonia ward (pre-antibiotic).”\n\nThe tent had collapsed on forty six stretcher cases inside...\n\n“though I shouted, nobody answered me, or I could hear nothing for the roar of planes and artillery. I seemed to be the only living thing about.”\n\nShe raced back to the tent and was shortly joined by the badly shaken Padre, who went off to get help (after urging her to take cover). She ignored the advice and again tried to get into the tent. Grabbing hold of a handle under the fly she tried to drag a stretcher free. The patient was dead, and the splintered handle came away in her hand, throwing her backwards into the crater again.\n\n“I cannot remember what came next, or what I did, except that I kept calling for the orderly to help me and thought he was funking, but the poor boy had been blown to bits. Somebody got the tent up, and when I got to the delirious pneumonia patient, he was crouched on the ground at the back of the stretcher. He took no notice of me when I asked him to return to bed, so I leaned across the stretcher and put one arm around and tried to lift him in. I had my right arm under a leg, which I thought was his, but when I lifted I found to my horror that it was a loose leg with a boot and a puttee on it. It was one of the orderly’s legs which had been blown off and had landed on the patient’s bed. The next day they found the trunk about 20 yards away.”\n\nTo put into some perspective the workloads and consequent stresses these nurses endured, consider:\n\nDuring the First World War, a one thousand bed hospital, in Cairo, completely under tentage, without any floor covering was staffed by 1 Matron, 15 Sisters and 30 Staff Nurses with male medical orderlies from the Australian Army Medical Corps.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541406948/o1du79fgrooyij8z7gek.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

          "content": "by **P. Andrews**\n\nThe Merchant Navy, as a Service, has no real way of displaying its capabilities. There is no compulsory wearing of uniforms, no street parades led by fine military bands, no pomp or ceremony of any sort to attract the general public or media. The only attention given to the Service is when some catastrophe or other occurs which raises the hackles of the conservationists, and this always seems to be to the detriment of the Merchant Navy.\n\nIf a warship is lost, by conflict or by dereliction of duty, we never hear the last of it. If a merchant ship is lost you seldom hear of it. I wonder how many people would consult the Lloyds list of ships lost worldwide in a single year. It runs into hundreds -- ships both large and small, many of them with the loss of all hands and leaving no trace.\n\nMerchant ships of all sizes quietly come and go. They visit ports both large and small across the world, carrying the raw materials of trade, oil and petroleum products and the manufactured goods of industry. These ships journey to and from all countries, and have been doing so for millennia. It is, however, in times of conflict that the Merchant Navy finds itself an indispensable force within the framework of military operations, and even then for safety and security reasons, a low profile is maintained.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488776/gzveoxtciutdwf3k0gyt.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Matunga carried stores, fuel and personnel of the Australian Navy and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF) to New Guinea, until she was captured and sunk by the German raiderWolf in August 1917.**\n\nIn wartime, nations with extensive global interests involved in such confrontations look towards their merchant ships for sea lift capabilities in the transportation of their military personnel, equipment and supplies to wherever -- and whenever -- they are required; to sustain them for the duration with the necessary arms and ammunition, fuel and food and all the paraphernalia of war; and then bring everyone safely back home again.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488819/u97aqxwsgec3wzmvzpij.png)\n\n**AWM H02227. Relatives and friends on the wharf farewelling Australian soldiers on their way overseas.**\n\nIt was an accepted fact of life that the Merchant Navy would go anywhere it was sent without argument. In the Boer War, it was the Merchant Navy which took all Australia’s troops to South Africa and brought them home again safely, but then there were then no submarines, enemy aircraft or mines to worry about.\n\nIn World War 1, the first person killed was a merchant seaman, when his ship, a brigantine, was sunk by gunfire from a German submarine in the North Atlantic.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488842/odk62osm9vi0yacs4tcy.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The last person to die after the cessation of hostilities with Germany was also a merchant seaman, when his ship was torpedoed in the North Atlantic three days after the war ended.\n\nFurthermore, we should not forget Atlantic Conveyor was the only British merchant ship sunk in the Falklands War but she was not the first ship sunk, for the cruiser ARA General Belgrano was sunk on 2 May and the destroyer HMS Sheffield sunk on 4 May, and others during the course of the next five weeks resulting in the death of many merchant seamen.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488873/odear65smprxzvx8urt8.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

As such she was bombed and heavily damaged in Darwin harbour by Japanese aircraft on 19 February 1942.**\n\nIt is not generally known that all hospital ships, royal fleet auxiliaries, armed merchant cruisers and most of the so-called Woolworth carriers of World War 2 were crewed by merchant seamen who sailed under the Red Ensign (Red Duster), Blue Ensign and the White Ensign. Whether they were on passenger liners, troopships, ocean going tugs, cargo ships, cross channel ferries, or fishing boats, the merchant seamen did their job without fuss and very often largely unnoticed.\n\nMerchant ships are not built for war and merchant seamen are not trained for war, whereas naval vessels are specially designed to absorb damage from enemy attack, and their crews are highly trained in damage control and gunnery.\n\nWe in Australia and New Zealand commemorate a day which is called ANZAC Day, a day which is set aside to remember and to pay homage to our fallen comrades. This day was born out of the Gallipoli campaign, but I wonder how many people are aware of the involvement of the Merchant Navy in that campaign. The merchant ships took all of our troops to Gallipoli, and in many cases landed our troops on the beach at ANZAC Cove in the ships’ lifeboats -- manned by merchant seamen, who also came under the deadly fire from the Turkish guns.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541489062/hgnavwytgt22xeyrt8wm.png)\n\nThe WW1 troopships at anchor in Mudros Harbour, Lemnos Island.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the great majority of wounded in that campaign were taken in the ships’ lifeboats -- with merchant seamen manning the oars -- to the hospital ships which were waiting offshore. The merchant ships evacuated most of our troops from Gallipoli to Alexandria, Lemnos and Cyprus and then transported the wounded home to Australia.\n\nWho could forget the horrors of the Atlantic convoys, in ships which in most instances were completely unable to defend themselves and were at the mercy of a ruthless enemy, day and night, for anything up to a month at a time? Between 1939 and 1945, in the so-called Battle of the Atlantic, nearly 3000 Allied and neutral merchant ships were sunk by enemy action, with a heavy loss of life. Nightmare trips to Archangel and Murmansk, suffering the rigours of an Arctic winter, while under continuous enemy attack, were endured by the crews of the merchant vessels to ensure that essential war equipment, supplies and foodstuffs got through to our Russian Allies.\n\nThose very hard-fought convoys to the small but intrepid Mediterranean island of Malta, on which so much of the war in the Middle East depended: whether the ships came from Alexandria or by way of Gibraltar, they were under constant attack while trying to keep open the supply lines to the vital beleaguered garrison.\n\nIn August 1942, one of the greatest sea battles of World War 2, Operation Pedestal, was fought by 14 merchant ships and a large fleet of naval vessels throughout five days of continuous warfare -- from air and sea, as the fleet endeavoured to get essential supplies to Malta. Why have so many people not heard of this operation? Was it just another convoy of merchant ships? I can tell you this; we lost more men in those five days of fighting than Australia lost in the whole of the Vietnam War.\n\nGenerally, a convoy of say 45 ships usually had an escort of about four or five corvettes and maybe one old destroyer. To give you some idea of the importance of this convoy of 14 ships to Malta, we had an escort of two battleships, five aircraft carriers, seven cruisers, 22 destroyers, seven submarines and 14 other sundry naval vessels. Yet, despite this level of support, at the end of the five days, only five merchant ships had survived and three of them were badly damaged.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic and in the Pacific, the threat of surface raiders and submarines with their mine layers was ever present. Even Australian home waters were not safe; in WW2, 55 merchant ships were sunk by enemy action in the surrounding seas.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541489087/patgg66uihoae5nxdk0q.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The effect of a thousand pound bomb on a small merchant ship lying in Tobruk harbour.**\n\nWherever the war was being waged, merchant ships were there taking troops and essential supplies to the heart of the action. The traversing of these supply lines by these vessels and their crews, I think you will agree, was an extremely hazardous occupation. The whole maritime world was their battleground. From the moment they left port, these ships and their crews were at war, not knowing when they might be attacked, blown up or disabled in some fashion. Some statistics of the cost to the Merchant Service in World War 2 deserve some contemplation:\n\n- 4996 British and Allied ships lost\n- 62933 British and Allied merchant seamen killed in action\n- 4000 wounded\n- 5000 merchant seamen taken as prisoners of war.\n\nCompare this with the 50,758 British and Commonwealth Naval personnel killed in the war. It has been estimated that the Merchant service losses amounted to one in six, compared to the combined armed forces of one in 33. It is also worthy of note that of the total casualties of merchant seamen, only 8.25 percent were wounded but 91.75 percent killed, compared with 79 percent wounded and 21 percent killed in the armed forces.\n\nDuring the Falklands War, 43 merchant ships were taken up from trade (the first of these within two days of the outbreak of hostilities with Argentina) together with 24 Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service vessels, all manned by merchant navy personnel. Merchant ships outnumbered naval vessels in this campaign. Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, Commander-in-Chief Fleet, said: I cannot say too often or too clearly that without the merchant ships taken up from trade and those remarkable merchant seamen, this operation could not have been undertaken, and I hope this message is clearly understood by the British Nation.\n\nIn time of relative peace, merchant seamen are often confronted by the relics of war and at times are required to enter areas of unrelated conflict. These, coupled with the inherent perils of the sea, are all taken in their stride. To those who survived, there is an obligation to ensure that those who were less fortunate are not forgotten, whether they be shipmates, friends serving in other ships, or simply bound to us by the brotherhood-of-the-sea. We are proud to be known as merchant seamen.\n\nJohn Curtin, our wartime Prime Minister, said of the merchant seaman: Whenever you see a man in the street wearing the distinctive MN badge, raise your hat to him because without these gallant men the war would be lost.\n\nWinston Churchill said on 27 January 1942: But for the Merchant Navy who bring us the food and munitions of war, Britain would be in a parlous state and indeed, without them, the Army, Navy and Air Force could not operate.\n\nJohn Beasley, the wartime Minister of Supply and Shipping said on 6 March 1943:With due deference to the splendid services of the armed forces, I can say that the recent operations around New Guinea and the South Pacific would not have succeeded but for the magnificent work and courage of the Merchant Navy.\n\nHM King George VI said: The task of the Merchant Navy is no less essential to the people’s existence than that allotted to the Navy, Army and Air Force, and indeed, none of them would be able to operate without these brave men.\n\nAnd finally, in October 1945, a tribute was paid to the Merchant Navy by the British Houses of Parliament which said:\n\n<p class=\"p-3\">The Minister of War Transport has been informed by the Lord Chancellor and by the Speaker of the House of Commons of the terms of the Resolutions in identical terms passed by both Houses of Parliament without dissent on the 30th October 1945, of which he has been requested to communicate the following portion to Masters, Officers and men of the Merchant Navy.That the thanks of this House be accorded to the Officers and Men of the Merchant Navy for the steadfastness with which that maintained our stocks of food and materials; for their services in transporting men, munitions and fuel to all the battles over all the seas; and for the gallantry with which, though a civilian service, they met and fought the constant attacks of the enemy. That this House doth acknowledge the Merchant Navy with humble gratitude and the sacrifice of all those who, on land or sea or in the air, have given their lives that others today may live as free men, and its heartfelt sympathy with their relatives in their proud sorrow. We shall never forget them, we were forgotten!</p>\n\n<div class=\"p-5\"><h4 class=\"font-weight-bold m-0\">In Memoriam\nMerchant Navy 1939-1945</h4><p>No cross marks the place where now we lie\nWhat happened is known but to us\nYou asked, and we gave our lives to protect\nOur land from the enemy curse\nNo Flanders Field where poppies blow;\nNo Gleaming Crosses, row on row;\nNo Unnamed Tomb for all to see\nAnd pause -- and wonder who we might be\nThe Sailors’ Valhalla is where we lie\nOn the ocean bed, watching ships pass by\nSailing in safety now thru’ the waves\nOften right over our sea-locked graves\nWe ask you just to remember us.</p></div>\n\n**Author's Note**: When a merchant ship was sunk, the seaman’s pay stopped on the day of the sinking. He did not receive any more pay until he joined another ship. The seaman was given 30 days survivor’s leave, dated from the day his ship was sunk. This leave was unpaid. It only meant that he didn’t have to report back to the pool for 30 days. If he spent 10 or 15 days in a lifeboat, or on a life raft, that time in the boat was counted as survivor’s leave. There were many merchant seamen who joined the Navy because it was extremely short of experienced seamen. They joined under what were known as T124X and T124T agreements. These men were in naval uniforms on naval ships under the White Ensign, with naval officers and subject to naval discipline. They received naval rates of pay. At the end of the war, they were not allowed to claim any compensation or any benefits, because they were discharged as merchant seamen.\n\n\n",

Whenever I came home from school, the house was full of women clicking knitting needles and manipulating dark wool, and making huge quantities of socks, vests, mittens and mufflers, as well as sewing pyjamas and shirts. Mum ran Red Cross classes with first aid and bandage rolling... Mum, who was a leading light in the CWA (Country Women's Association) as well as the Red Cross, spent more and more of her time on the war effort... Nora Pennington, the good little girl who had written the composition about Gallipoli, was the school's champion sock knitter.

Women’s contribution to the workforce rose from 24 per cent of the total in 1914 to 37 per cent in 1918, but the increase tended to be in what were already traditional areas of women’s work - in the clothing and footwear, food and printing sectors. There was some increase also in the clerical, shop assistant and teaching areas. Unions were unwilling to let women join the workforce in greater numbers in traditional male areas as they feared that this would lower wages.\n\n![cartoon from the worker](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544000672/f3ys5r9c5dnxfg2mdmdb.png)\n\n*Cartoon from 'The Worker' 10 February 1916.

          "content": "An overview by **Robert Lewis**\n\n*The year 2004 marks the 90th anniversary of the onset of the First World War. Australia’s support of Great Britain as the ‘Mother Country’ meant that this country was also at war. The information that follows examines the impact this conflict had on the fledgling Australian nation. A range of issues, such as: the male population’s reaction to recruiting drives; Gallipoli, where the national character was tested and found not wanting; the government’s wider range of powers over some aspects of people’s lives; effects on the economy, and the changing role of women has been addressed and enhanced with cartoons, posters and photographs from the time.*\n\n## Initial reactions\n\nThe outbreak of war in August 1914 seemed to unleash a huge wave of enthusiastic support for Britain, and support for Australia’s part in the war. All major political parties, churches, community leaders and newspapers seemed to support Australia’s entry. It was seen as a moral and necessary commitment. There was a rush to the recruiting offices, and, at this stage, only the very fittest and healthiest men were accepted.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425369/wjokvydo3z0lsldh5egv.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425376/drkavejp9bhutdq1h2e2.png)\n\nThe whole country seemed to be both enthusiastic for the war, and united in support of it. There is, however, some evidence that this is an incomplete and even distorted impression. There are hints and suggestions of the fracture lines in society that would later lead to great bitterness and divisions in Australian society. For example, while many tried to enlist, far more did not. Even during the first enlistment rush, there are stories of white feathers being sent, and women rejecting and abusing men who did not enlist. There were also some who actively opposed Australia’s entry into the war, though their voice seems to have had few ways of being heard at the time.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425415/g3x6muu2q7bw5wghfoda.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425420/xrpddyc7oqpleolhaj8f.png)\n\n## Gallipoli\n\nThe landing at Gallipoli was a major event in the war. Even though the Gallipoli campaign was a military defeat, it helped to provide Australians with a new sense of their identity and place in the world. One reason is the fact that the landing was a separate action in the war. It was not swallowed up in the general war news. People in Australia knew their boys were training for their ‘baptism of fire’ and when it came the Australians were an identifiable body of troops. So what happened was able to be isolated and analysed as an action by Australians.\n\nThe reporting of the landing also influenced people’s reactions to the event. The glowing tribute of the British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett gave the achievement an authenticity -- here was someone who should know who was making such a positive and favourable judgement. Another reason for the reaction in Australia is the possibility that most people in Australia had some connection with the men of the first AIF who landed at Gallipoli. Death notices on the first anniversary were sent not only by parents, husbands, sisters and sons and daughters -- but also friends, cousins, work mates, fellow church members, and families of soldier mates. The ripples of those directly affected by the landing spread throughout much of Australian society.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425442/ggbxe6tg1syy0trp2c3i.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425448/qrvy6zxhkxqox18ndlan.png)\n\nAustralia had been a nation for just 14 years, and there was an uncertainty about how they would measure up as a race against the people who had founded them, the British. There was also a belief in society that war was a testing ground for individual and national character. Australians had been brought up on the glories of British military exploits. They were now part of that picture, and were able to match themselves against the best in the ultimate test. In the words of one contemporary, ‘They had been tested, and not found wanting’. So Gallipoli was a great sigh of relief that the test had been passed, an affirmation of their national worth.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s in particular some commentators challenged the strength or relevance of the ANZAC legend, arguing that it had little relevance to women, to a multicultural Australia, and to an era when a military heritage was tarnished by widespread anti-Vietnam War feeling. Such criticism seems to miss the point. The ANZAC legend does not have to mean that any individual could be an ANZAC, but that the ANZACs represented the values and behaviour and qualities of the whole society -- and the ANZAC qualities of bravery, perseverance, mateship, determination and all the other positive aspects that can be found in the story are still what we would show if we were tested again. \n\n## Deaths and casualties\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425473/lsmebyzzp9xvkdbskpml.png)\n\nSign says: 'To the memory of the brave lads who fell at Gallipoli, 1915'\nMan's bag says: 'Interest on War Loans'\n\nAfter the retreat from Gallipoli, most Australian soldiers eventually became involved in the trench warfare of the Western Front. Despite repeated attempts, little ground was won and kept between 1916 and 1918. The war became one that had to be grimly endured, and the first flush of enthusiasm for the war and the thrilling achievement at Gallipoli soon led to a more harsh and realistic attitude towards war as, over time, the death and casualty lists increased.\n\n## Recruiting\n\nContinued casualties led to great recruiting campaigns. The strongest believers in the war could not understand how others in society might not share their attitude that the war demanded every person’s full and total commitment. Nothing else was of any importance until the war was won.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425503/zmbt7pimf2upwkwbrfde.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544425509/cqllglutjstsw3btzklp.png)\n\nOthers, however, believed that there were other priorities that still should be pursued -- particularly when the economic costs of the war pushed wages down and prices up. These people believed that the war was being fought for a particular way of life -- and it was patriotic to maintain that way of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘patriots’ tried to gain recruits for the war. There were two ways in which this could be done: by ‘persuasion’, or by ‘force’. ‘Persuasion’ involved appealing to the individual’s sense of what was right and wrong to do in the circumstances; ‘force’ involved accusation, confrontation and guilt.\n\nOne of the main divisive figures of the war was Norman Lindsay. Many of his posters encouraged hatred of the enemy, or confrontation between groups of Australians, or both.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426251/ot2mcqc0l1ytk5gudkvo.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426258/t5pvncakurwxjmt8fayq.png)\n\n## Government powers\n\nThe war saw governments take on new and wide powers over aspects of people’s lives. The Commonwealth Government was the great ‘winner’ from the war. Running a war was a national event, and it became clear that the Commonwealth would need to increase its authority as well as its spending and revenue-raising powers to prosecute the war successfully and effectively. One of its major actions was to pass the War Precautions Act. The Act gave the Commonwealth great jurisdiction -- powers that were far greater than it would have under peace conditions.\n\nThe War Precautions Act gave the Commonwealth Government weight in two main areas. It could make laws that were normally not within its prerogative -- so in effect the Constitution which normally limited the Commonwealth’s power was suspended for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. The War Precautions Act and the Defence Act gave the Commonwealth authority to make laws about anything that affected the war effort -- and High Court interpretations in disputes meant that this covered almost anything. In a famous quote, a member of parliament asked the Commonwealth’s main law officer, the Solicitor-General Sir Robert Garran, ‘Would it be an offence under the War Precautions Act …?’ ‘Yes!’ said Garran.\n\nThe other great change was that many of these new powers available to the Commonwealth were able to be exercisable under Regulation, meaning that parliament did not have to pass the law, all it required was a document prepared by the relevant Minister, and signed by the Governor-General. So in effect parliament lost much of its control during the war, and laws were made by a few Ministers.\n\nSome of the major activities carried out under the authority of the War Precautions Act by the Commonwealth were:\n\n- passing Trading With the Enemy Acts that cancelled existing commercial contracts with firms in enemy countries;\n- creating loans to raise money for the war;\n- taking on power to tax incomes -- they shared this with the States, who previously had this power for themselves;\n- fixing the price of many goods -- something that the Constitution did not give the Commonwealth the prerogative to do normally;\n- interning (locking up) without trial people who were born in or had an association with enemy countries;\n- compulsorily buying farmers’ wheat and wool crops; and\n- censoring publications and letters.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe war had a great effect on the Australian economy, and the repercussions of these changes were mixed.\nOne of the earliest impacts of the war was the government’s cancellation of existing trade agreements with Germany and Austria-Hungary. As a result, Australian firms in industries such as steel-making and pharmaceuticals suddenly found themselves taking up contracts that had previously been filled by German rivals -- and fortunes were suddenly available to firms such as BHP and Nicholas.\n\nThe government was keen to make sure that Australian wheat, wool and meat reached Britain and helped the war effort there. So it passed a law giving it the power to compulsorily acquire the whole wheat and wool harvests -- an impossible action under the Constitution, but able to be done under the War Precautions Act.\n\nHowever, shortages and war profiteering (selling scarce goods at a very high price) meant that many ordinary working people suffered a fall in their purchasing power, and their standard of living. This led to a series of major strikes in the major cities.\nTo finance the war the Commonwealth had a series of war loans, and then peace loans. All were over-subscribed. This seemed to some to be further evidence of the inequality of sacrifice in the war -- those with money to spare could actually profit from the war, while others were suffering economic loss and decline.\n\nThe war provided a form of protection to Australian industries -- removing competition. By the end of the war more than 400 products were being produced in Australia which had not been produced here before the war.\n\n## Conscription\n\nIn 1916 Prime Minister Hughes proposed raising the numbers needed to maintain Australian troops at full strength at the Front by conscripting those who to date were unwilling or opposed to enlisting to fight. The government already had the power under the existing provisions of the Defence Act to conscript men -- but only for service in Australia. They could not be sent overseas to fight.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426339/cpedjyck8wrkihhhxdy7.png)\n\nAll the government needed to do was to change the Defence Act to extend the existing power of conscription from home service, to overseas service. All it had to do to achieve that change in legislation was to pass an amendment through both houses of parliament -- the Senate, and the House of Representatives.\n\nBut there was a problem. Some members of the Labor Government were against conscription. Hughes knew that he had enough supporters of conscription among the Labor and Liberal parties to have a majority in the House of Representatives; but he was a few short of a majority in the Senate.\n\nTo overcome this problem Hughes decided to hold a national vote on the issue. This vote is sometimes called a referendum, and sometimes called a plebiscite. Strictly speaking a referendum is a vote to change the Constitution. There was no need to change the Constitution in this case, as the Constitution already gave the government power to introduce conscription. So the vote was in effect a national ‘public opinion poll’ on the issue. The vote would not mean anything officially -- but what Hughes planned was that he would be able to use the public vote in favour of conscription to persuade a few Senators to change their vote in parliament. Even though the Senators were personally against it, the vote would show that the people they represented in fact wanted conscription, so the Senators would accept the people’s wishes. That was the theory.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426353/eaflayaccfkcruthwcu4.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426360/niqryffcrn0y3srwnfcp.png)\n\nThe supporters and opponents of conscription started campaigning vigorously on the issue. The campaign literature of each side was often bitter and divisive. Each side presented its argument as the moral and loyal thing to do, while the other’s approach would be disastrous.\n\nThe vote was very close -- with conscription being rejected 51 to 49 per cent. Many commentators asked why conscription was rejected. A better question may be, why was the vote so close?\n\nfocus for a lot of different points of view about the war. Some people opposed the war; others were opposed to conscription as a principle; some were saying that they were hurt by the economic situation of the war, and were protesting against that; still others were voting to protect unionism; and there were those who were protesting at the British treatment of the rebels in Ireland. Normally these people might not have agreed with each other on many things, but they all agreed on the conscription question, and the issue gave them all a chance to express their opposition.\n\nIn 1917 Hughes held another vote on the issue. This time he actually had a majority in both Houses of Parliament, and did not need the vote. He wanted, however, to give the people another chance to overcome what he saw as their great mistake in rejecting conscription the previous year -- a chance to redeem themselves. The campaign was again bitter and divisive, and conscription was again defeated, this time by a slightly larger margin.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426381/u24m0q0bgvk7fpla5fwo.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426387/ki3z59ufq98xslnobvdm.png)\n\n## Easter uprising\n\nOne of the elements that influenced many people’s reaction to the war was the Easter Uprising in Ireland. Ireland was under British control, but many Irish were nationalists -- they wanted Ireland to be its own country. On Easter Sunday 1916, a group of IRA rebels seized buildings in Dublin as the start of an uprising. The British troops there quickly defeated the rebels. Many were taken prisoner, tried, and executed.\n\nMany Australians had strong ties to Ireland, and there was also a strong connection between the Roman Catholic religion and Ireland -- many of the Church’s priests, nuns and teaching staff were Irish born. The Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix, was particularly staunch in his condemnation of the brutal British suppression of the rebellion, and he increasingly distanced himself from support of the war -- influencing many of his flock to do the same. But it is not accurate to say that Australia became divided along religious and ethnic lines -- Protestant British versus Irish Catholics -- as there were important religious leaders, particularly Archbishop Kelly of Sydney, who did not support the Irish uprising.\n\n## Political change\n\nThe war led to great changes in political life.\n\nIn 1914 the Liberals were in power, but were defeated at the general election that was under way at the outbreak of the war. The Australian Labor Party became the Government, with Andrew Fisher, and then from 1915 William Morris Hughes as the Prime Minister.\n\nHughes, a Welsh immigrant as well as a Labor member, enthusiastically supported Australian involvement in the war, and saw himself as responsible for making sure that Australia fulfilled its role as part of the Empire. By 1916 he was convinced that the great losses being suffered on the Western Front could not be met by voluntary recruiting, and that those men who were not ‘doing their duty’ needed to be conscripted into the fight. This caused great division within the Labor Party.\n\nAfter the defeat of the first Conscription Referendum, Hughes and a number of others left the Labor party, and joined with the Liberals to form a new Nationalist party, determined to do everything possible to win the war. This new Nationalist party became the government for the rest of the war.\n\nHughes’ pro-war enthusiasm led him into conflict with one of his strongest critics -- the Queensland Australian Labor Party Premier, T. J. Ryan. Ryan did all he could to defeat conscription -- and in doing so clashed with Hughes. In one famous incident at Warwick Station, Hughes was hit by an egg thrown by an anti-conscription protester. Hughes felt, probably correctly, that Ryan did nothing to stop the incident or to track down the protester, so Hughes created the Federal Police to pursue Commonwealth matters! In another incident, Hughes had banned certain anti-conscription material, but Ryan had the material reproduced in Queensland’s Hansard, the record of parliamentary proceedings, and exempt from normal censorship.\n\n## War weariness\n\nBy 1917 and 1918, people were increasingly war-weary. The deaths and casualties mounted; there seemed to be no substantial victories; the war seemed to be at a stalemate; the economic costs of the war continued to hurt many in the community; recruits now only trickled in where they had flowed in 1915 and 1916.\n\n## Women’s role\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426449/j6uwnzl3k6w1h3bugudx.png)\n\nAt the outbreak of war far fewer women than men participated in work, and these tended to be in lower-paid occupations. Women’s main role was seen to be in the home. The withdrawal of about half a million men most of whom had been in the workforce did not, however, result in their direct replacement by women.\n\nWomen’s contribution to the workforce rose from 24 per cent of the total in 1914 to 37 per cent in 1918, but the increase tended to be in what were already traditional areas of women’s work -- in the clothing and footwear, food and printing sectors. There was some increase also in the clerical, shop assistant and teaching areas. Unions were unwilling to let women join the workforce in greater numbers in traditional male areas as they feared that this would lower wages.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426465/nf0oqgilctewpi5o6gas.png)\n\n**Top**: Sewing rabbitskin vests and shirts for the Australian Comforts Fund, Melbourne Town Hall. **Below**: Canned goods collected by New South Wales children being sorted by Red Cross volunteers.\n\nMany women sought to become more involved in war-related activities -- such as cooks, stretcher bearers, motor car drivers, interpreters, munitions workers -- but the government did not allow this participation.\n\nA number of women’s organisations did become very active during the war -- including the Australian Women’s National League, the Australian Red Cross, the Country Women’s Association, the Voluntary Aid Detachment, the Australian Women’s Service Corps, and the Women’s Peace Army.\n\nOne of the most active groups was the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, which succeeded in having hotel hours restricted in several States.\n\nMany women were also actively involved in encouraging men to enlist, and were often used in recruiting and pro- and anti-conscription propaganda leaflets.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426494/lqg2oxg7wdct1zc2v6jk.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426500/t9sbisdqe7lswolojdgv.png)\n\n**Oral history**.  We began hearing a lot about 'the war effort' and people stopped saying the war would be over in six months, or even a year. Whenever I came home from school, the house was full of women clicking knitting needles and manipulating dark wool, and making huge quantities of socks, vests, mittens and mufflers, as well as sewing pyjamas and shirts. Mum ran Red Cross classes with first aid and bandage rolling … Mum, who was a leading light in the CWA (Country Women's Association) as well as the Red Cross, spent more and more of her time on the war effort... Nora Pennington, the good little girl who had written the composition about Gallipoli, was the school's champion sock knitter. At lunchtime and recess she sat with her ankles neatly crossed and her boots buttoned, turning the heels of the socks very prettily. She eventually won the district record for the number of socks, mufflers, mittens and balaclava helmets knitted by anybody under the age of thirteen; her father made sure that the news reached the front page of his paper, with the heading 'LITTLE NORA DOES HER BIT'. The rest of us longed to grab her knitting, rip the stitches out and snarl the wool for her. David Gleason in Jacqueline Kent, 'In The Half LIght', Doubleday Sydney 1988 pp56-58\n\n## Sport \n\nDuring the war there were many calls for normal entertainments such as competitive sport to be abandoned. This was mainly because it was felt that the continuation of sport distracted people’s attention from the serious business of the war -- and also because competitive sport seemed to be a flaunting by eligible young men of the fact that they had not volunteered to fight. It was a sign of less than total commitment to the war. Amateur sports did tend to stop for the duration, but the semi-professional football competitions continued.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544426525/lnzgkxw8abc1ycut6o2c.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The 1911 census showed that there were 33,381 German-born residents in Australia, most of whom lived in South Australia and Queensland. These German citizens had to register at local police stations.\nHowever, the war caused many Australians to turn against their German neighbours, even though they may even have been naturalised and had sons fighting in the AIF. This hostile attitude was sometimes the result of jealousy, but was also encouraged by the crude official anti-German propaganda. Local authorities also often trampled on the human rights of these people with unjustified searches, surveillance and arrest. 4500 ‘Germans’ were interned during the war, 700 of whom were naturalised and 70 Australian born. At the end of the war, 6150 Germans and other enemy alien nationals were deported.\nHowever, the majority of German nationals living in Australia managed mostly to escape public notice and persecution.\n\n## The ‘Butcher’s Bill’\n\nThe fighting in World War 1 ended at 11am on 11 November 1918. But the deaths and suffering did not end then. To soldiers at the time, the casualties were referred to as the ‘butcher’s bill’. More than eighty years later the cost of the war is still with us -- the butcher’s bill is still being paid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The glowing tribute of the British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett gave the achievement an authenticity - here was someone who should know who was making such a positive and favourable judgement.\n\nAnother reason for the reaction in Australia is the possibility that most people in Australia had some connection with the men of the first AIF who landed at Gallipoli. Death notices on the first anniversary were sent not only by parents, husbands, sisters and sons and daughters - but also friends, cousins, work mates, fellow church members, and families of soldier mates. The ripples of those directly affected by the landing spread throughout much of Australian society.\n\nAustralia had been a nation for just 14 years, and there was an uncertainty about how they would measure up as a race against the people who had founded them, the British. There was also a belief in society that war was a testing ground for individual and national character. Australians had been brought up on the glories of British military exploits. They were now part of that picture, and were able to match themselves against the best in the ultimate test. In the words of one contemporary, ‘They had been tested, and not found wanting’. So Gallipoli was a great sigh of relief that the test had been passed, an affirmation of their national worth.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s in particular some commentators challenged the strength or relevance of the ANZAC legend, arguing that it had little relevance to women, to a multicultural Australia, and to an era when a military heritage was tarnished by widespread anti-Vietnam War feeling. Such criticism seems to miss the point. The ANZAC legend does not have to mean that any individual could be an ANZAC, but that the ANZACs represented the values and behaviour and qualities of the whole society - and the ANZAC qualities of bravery, perseverance, mateship, determination and all the other positive aspects that can be found in the story are still what we would show if we were tested again.\n\nTo investigate this aspect of the Home Front experience by using evidence from the time, see *Home Fronts at War*, Ryebuck Media for ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland.\n\n(More about the book  HOME FRONTS AT WAR)\n\n",

The strongest believers in the war could not understand how others in society might not share their attitude that the war demanded every person’s full and total commitment. Nothing else was of any importance until the war was won.\n\nOthers, however, believed that there were other priorities that still should be pursued - particularly when the economic costs of the war pushed wages down and prices up. These people believed that the war was being fought for a particular way of life - and it was patriotic to maintain that way of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘patriots’ tried to gain recruits for the war. There were two ways in which this could be done: by ‘persuasion’, or by ‘force’. ‘Persuasion’ involved appealing to the individual’s sense of what was right and wrong to do in the circumstances; ‘force’ involved accusation, confrontation and guilt.\n\nThese two posters show the difference between the two approaches:\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544430414/nlguugrox3sk7l11mqay.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544430420/nkhbijlqmosdbtpe2rmm.png)\n\nOne of the main divisive figures of the war was Norman Lindsay.

          "content": "The war saw governments take on new and wide powers over aspects of people’s lives.\n\nThe Commonwealth Government was the great ‘winner’ from the war. Running a war was a national event, and it became clear that the Commonwealth would need to increase its authority as well as its spending and revenue-raising powers to prosecute the war successfully and effectively.\n\nOne of its major actions was to pass the War Precautions Act. The Act gave the Commonwealth great jurisdiction - powers that were far greater than it would have under peace conditions.\n\nThe War Precautions Act gave the Commonwealth Government weight in two main areas. It could make laws that were normally not within its prerogative - so in effect the Constitution which normally limited the Commonwealth’s power was suspended for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. The War Precautions Act and the Defence Act gave the Commonwealth authority to make laws about anything that affected the war effort - and High Court interpretations in disputes meant that this covered almost anything. In a famous quote, a member of parliament asked the Commonwealth’s main law officer, the Solicitor-General Sir Robert Garran, ‘Would it be an offence under the War Precautions Act ...’ ‘Yes!’ said Garran.\n\nThe other great change was that many of these new powers available to the Commonwealth were able to be exercisable under Regulation, meaning that parliament did not have to pass the law, all it required was a document prepared by the relevant Minister, and signed by the Governor-General. So in effect parliament lost much of its control during the war, and laws were made by a few Ministers.\n\nSome of the major activities carried out under the authority of the War Precautions Act by the Commonwealth were:\n\n- passing Trading With the Enemy Acts that cancelled existing commercial contracts with firms in enemy countries;\n- creating loans to raise money for the war;\n- taking on power to tax incomes - they shared this with the States, who previously had this power for themselves;\n- fixing the price of many goods - something that the Constitution did not give the Commonwealth the prerogative to do normally;\n- interning (locking up) without trial people who were born in or had an association with enemy countries;\n- compulsorily buying farmers’ wheat and wool crops; and\n- censoring publications and letters.",

          "content": "The war had a great effect on the Australian economy, and the impacts of these changes were mixed.\n\nOne of the earliest impacts of the war was the government’s cancellation of existing trade agreements with Germany and Austria-Hungary. So Australian firms in industries such as steel-making and pharmaceuticals suddenly found themselves taking up contracts that had previously been filled by German rivals - and fortunes were suddenly available to firms such as BHP and Nicholas.\n\nThe government was keen to make sure that Australian wheat, wool and meat reached Britain and helped the war effort there. So it passed a law giving it the power to compulsorily acquire the whole wheat and wool harvests - an impossible action under the Constitution, but able to be done under the War Precautions Act.\n\n- 1915 - No wheat available to Britain from Russia.\n- Poor crops in North America.\n- Britain bought the whole refrigerated mutton and beef supply for the rest of the war.\n- Whole wool clip bought at 55% above pre-war values.\n\nHowever, shortages and war profiteering (selling scarce goods at a very high price) meant that many ordinary working people suffered a fall in their purchasing power, and their standard of living. This led to a series of major strikes in the major cities.\n\n- Government dropped a referendum to get price fixing powers.\n\nTo finance the war the Commonwealth had a series of war loans, and then peace loans. All were over-subscribed. This seemed to some to be further evidence of the inequality of sacrifice in the war - those with money to spare could actually profit from the war, while others were suffering economic loss and decline.\n\nThe war provided a form of protection to Australian industries - removing competition. By the end of the war over 400 products were being produced in Australia which had not been produced here before the war.\n\n",

The butt of the rifle carried by the woman has \"YES\" emblazoned on it.\n\nThe government already had the power under the existing provisions of the Defence Act to conscript men - but only for service in Australia. They could not be sent overseas to fight.\n\nAll the government needed to do was to change the Defence Act to extend the existing power of conscription for home service, to overseas service. All it had to do to achieve that change in legislation was to pass an amendment through both houses of parliament - the Senate, and the House of Representatives.\n\nBut there was a problem. Some members of the Labor Government were against conscription. Hughes knew that he had enough supporters of conscription among the Labor and Liberal parties to have a majority in the House of Representatives; but he was a few short of a majority in the Senate.\n\nTo overcome this problem Hughes decided to hold a national vote on the issue.\n\nThis vote is sometimes called a referendum, and sometimes called a plebiscite. Strictly speaking a referendum is a vote to change the Constitution. There was no need to change the Constitution in this case, as the Constitution already gave the government power to introduce conscription. So the vote was in effect a national ‘public opinion poll’ on the issue. The vote would not mean anything officially - but what Hughes planned was that he would be able to use the public vote in favour of conscription to persuade a few Senators to change their vote in parliament. Even though the Senators were personally against it, the vote would show that the people they represented in fact wanted conscription, so the Senators would accept the people’s wishes. That was the theory.\n\nThe supporters and opponents of conscription started campaigning vigorously on the issue. The campaign literature of each side was often bitter and divisive. Each side presented its side as the moral and loyal thing to do, while the other’s approach would be disastrous.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1544432495/qre42uaqmamua8brxzl2.png)\n\nA poster from the time.\n\nThe vote was very close - with conscription being rejected 51 to 49 per cent.\n\nMany commentators asked why conscription was rejected. A better question may be, why was the vote so close?\n\nOne reason why so many opposed conscription was that it provided a focus for a lot of different points of view about the war. Some people opposed the war; others were opposed to conscription as a principle; others were saying that they were hurt by the economic situation of the war, and were protesting against that; still others were voting to protect unionism; others were protesting at the British treatment of the rebels in Ireland. Normally these people might not have agreed with each other on many things, but they all agreed on the conscription question, and the issue gave them all a chance to express their opposition.\n\nIn 1917 Hughes held another vote on the issue. This time he actually had a majority in both Houses of Parliament, and did not need the vote. He wanted, however, to give the people another chance to overcome what he saw as their great mistake in rejecting conscription the previous year - a chance to redeem themselves. The campaign was again bitter and divisive, and conscription was again defeated, this time by a slightly larger margin.\n\nTo investigate this aspect of the Home Front experience by using evidence from the time, see *Home Fronts at War*, Ryebuck Media for ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland.\n\n(More about the book  HOME FRONTS AT WAR)",

The British troops there quickly defeated the rebels. Many were taken prisoner, tried, and executed.\n\nMany Australians had strong ties to Ireland, and there was also a strong connection between the Roman Catholic religion and Ireland - many of the Church’s priests, nuns and teaching staff were Irish born.\n\nThe Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix, was particularly strong in his condemnation of the brutal British suppression of the rebellion, and he increasingly distanced himself from support of the war - influencing many of his flock to do the same.\n\nBut it is not accurate to say that Australia became divided along religious and ethnic lines - Protestant British versus Irish Catholics - as there were important religious leaders, particularly Archbishop Kelly of Sydney, who did not support the Irish uprising.\n\nTo investigate this aspect of the Home Front experience by using evidence from the time, see *Home Fronts at War*, Ryebuck Media for ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland.\n\n(More about the book  HOME FRONTS AT WAR)",

Prime Minister Hughes is at the right, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George is at the left. Both men were born in Wales.\n\nBy 1916 he was convinced that the great losses being suffered on the Western Front could not be met by voluntary recruiting, and that those men who were not ‘doing their duty’ needed to be conscripted into the fight. This caused great division within the Labor Party.\n\nAfter the defeat of the first Conscription Referendum, Hughes and a number of others left the Labor party, and joined with the Liberals to form a new Nationalist party, determined to do everything possible to win the war. This new Nationalist party became the government for the rest of the war.\n\nHughes’ pro-war enthusiasm led him into conflict with one of his strongest critics - the Queensland Australian Labor Party Premier, T. J. Ryan. Ryan did all he could to defeat conscription - and in doing so clashed with Hughes. In one famous incident at Warwick Station, Hughes was hit by an egg thrown by an anti-conscription protester. Hughes felt, probably correctly, that Ryan did nothing to stop the incident or to track down the protester, so Hughes created the Federal Police to pursue Commonwealth matters! In another incident, Hughes had banned certain anti-conscription material, but Ryan had the material reproduced in Queensland’s Hansard, the record of parliamentary proceedings, and exempt from normal censorship.\n\nTo investigate this aspect of the Home Front experience by using evidence from the time, see *Home Fronts at War*, Ryebuck Media for ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland.\n\n(More about the book  HOME FRONTS AT WAR)",

          "content": "Adapted from the book ‘Don't forget me, cobber!’ by [Matt Anderson](/about-matt-anderson)\n\nNot all brave acts at Gallipoli met with success, however. The film ‘Gallipoli’ tells the story of the 10th Light Horse Regiment from Western Australia and the brave but pointless attack at a place called The Nek. After several mistakes that gave the Turks time to prepare for an attack, the Australians fixed bayonets, leapt out of their trenches and charged the Turkish lines. In just 30 seconds, the first wave of men had all been killed or wounded. The Turks eventually stopped shooting and the battlefield fell silent. The loudest noise was the heartbeat of the men who were next to go over the top.\n\nAfter only two minutes, the second wave stormed from the trenches, into the wall of hot lead and steel. The final wave of ANZACs remained in the trench. They knew the attack was now pointless, and waited for the Generals down on the beach to order them to stop. But the only order they received was to attack. Brothers said goodbye to each other, and friends stood side by side. As they leapt out of the trench they jumped over the bodies of their friends who had been alive only minutes earlier, and knew they would soon join them. No ANZACs ever reached the Turkish trenches. In 1919, after the war was over, several ANZACs went back to Gallipoli to bury their dead properly. At the Nek, they found the bodies of more than 300 Australians in an area smaller than a tennis court.\n\nAfter eight long months of bitter fighting, the British High Command decided that the war at Gallipoli was too costly when they were also fighting other battles in Europe. The ANZACs alone had lost 10,000 men, and so the order came for a withdrawal.\n\nThis news upset the ANZACs, as they never thought that they would leave Gallipoli until they had won. Too many of their mates had died to give up now. But the order was final. The ANZACs decided that if they had to leave, then they would do it properly. Somehow they had to sneak off the Gallipoli peninsula, right from under the noses of the Turks.\n\nOver two weeks, 35,000 Australians were evacuated from Gallipoli. First off were the wounded, then the mules and heavy guns and equipment, and finally the soldiers. Right up until the last day the ANZACs tried to make everything look normal.\n\nThey played cricket and walked around smoking and talking in the open. They rigged rifles – ‘ghost guns’ they called them – so that they would fire after the owners had left.\n\n![ANZACs playing cricket](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543997068/imi3tw3bdmfm0nwqwfin.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Water dripped slowly from the top tin into the one below. The rifle fired when the bottom tin became heavy enough to pull a wire attached to the trigger. (AWM G01291) **\n\nAnd night after night they wrapped sandbags around their boots and quietly made their way down to the beach for evacuation. “No talking, lads, no smoking,” they were told by their sergeants.\n\nMany stopped by the graves of brothers, mates, even fathers, and hoped those buried far from home couldn’t hear them leaving.\n\nNews of the [terrible losses](/bitter-medicine1) at Gallipoli was printed daily in the newspapers back home in Australia. Included in these lists were the names of the fathers, brothers and mates now buried, or missing, on the peninsula. But instead of making Australians too frightened to enlist, the news did the opposite. In July 1915, when the casualty figures coming back from Gallipoli were at their worst, more than 36,000 men volunteered. (This is more than in the whole Army today [1998]!) Veterans of Gallipoli called these men the ‘fair dinkums’. “Any man who volunteers after knowing the horror of Gallipoli must be fair dinkum,” they said.",

And what a prize it was! With the help of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee each attended the Brisbane ANZAC Day Dawn Service and lay a wreath before witnessing just how the city honours The Fallen and holds dear all those who continue to defend our nation’s freedom.\n\nExtras on the trip included attending the Cosentino show at QPAC and meeting him after the show; enjoying a performance of Cirque Du Soleil; a lunchtime river cruise; a tour of the State Library of Queensland's Distant Lines exhibition — including a “white gloves” tour of war memorabilia; and a visit to the Amberley Aviation Heritage display.\n\n“Aiden and Grace met so many inspiring people during their Brisbane visit and will take many longlasting and cherished memories back to their family, friends and community in Cunnamulla,” Ms Hickey said.\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/qnwgwzfsfiimu3vegweh.pdf)\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/ttdawytaho67o3t3aetd.pdf)\n\n**In Pictures --**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468813/yogxkvbaaipdig6agfki.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace with ADCC President Arthur Burke OAM**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468854/jecefa7rjwqxlp2nb8rk.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace after Wreath Laying**\n<div class=\"list-group list-group-flush\">\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Themes</strong> -- Themes collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/themes\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Wars</strong> -- Collection of Wars history page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/wars\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Interactives</strong> -- Interactives collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/interactives\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Memorials</strong> -- Learn about some of the many memorials erected in Australia and other countries honouring Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/war-memorials\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Medals</strong> - A display of some of the medals awarded to Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/medals\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Classroom Activities</strong> - A selection of activities for upper primary and secondary pupils.

All Queensland schools were sent additional free copies of this book as part of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland's 1998 ANZAC Education Pack.</p>\n\nThe Western Front was the name the Germans gave to a series of trenches that ran 700 kilometres from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. To imagine this, think of a ditch deep enough to stand in zigzagging its way alongside the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Canberra. As at Gallipoli, machine-gun fire caused terrible casualties on the Western Front. Both sides had dug trenches, sometimes only metres apart, as their only protection from the murderous gun fire. But they were never safe from the explosive artillery shells that rained down on the front line soldiers every few seconds for days at a time. The British High Command needed troops urgently. So after the Gallipoli veterans were rested in Egypt, and had been strengthened by the ‘fair dinkums’ from Australia, they were sent to France to fight Germany. But Gallipoli was not the last time the ANZACs fought the Turks. The Light Horsemen were sent to the Middle East where they took part in several battles, the most spectacular of which was the mounted charge at Beersheeba.\n\n**NOTE** This symbol means that a detailed map is available. The maps have been prepared as Adobe Acrobat™ files, each ~200kb, and designed to print on two A4 pages.  \n\n**Life in the trenches**\n\nWhen the ANZACs arrived at the Western Front, the first thing they saw were the lines of wounded soldiers being taken to the rear. As they got closer, they could feel the earth shake, and hear the constant “crump crump” of artillery shells. The sound was loud enough to make their ears ring, and became their companion for the next three years.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400069/mgtbztzfdvuvuqjvn35n.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Boxes, cart wheels, wire and often the bodies of the dead and dying were strewn everywhere. These were the reserve trenches, far enough from the battle for soldiers to try to grab a little rest from all the madness in the front line.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400124/cnc4kqnl0tsoa8bagxzh.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM E862)**\n\nBut the ANZACs were soon to realise that the Germans were not the only enemy. The [winter of 1916](/snow-bound) was one of the worst on record. Living in these trenches was to cause nearly as many casualties as the fighting. The ANZACs had only two blankets each and had to sleep as close as possible to one another just to survive.\n\nImagine a winter so cold that water was carried to the soldiers as blocks of ice. Think how cold it must have been to wake after a few hours sleep only to find your eyelids frozen shut. And imagine if you had to keep a bottle of ink in your pocket, otherwise the ink would freeze. Imagine your feet swelling to three times their normal size because you had been standing for a week in water up to your knees. And think how cold it must have been when ice formed around the rim of a boiling cup of tea after you had carried it only 20 paces.\n\nThe ANZACs’ first major battle in Europe was near a town called Fromelles (From-el) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400561/xdcqvbowkxfpqdelldiz.pdf). For many it was also their last. The men received orders to attack the third line of the Germans’ trenches. They marched across no-man’s-land and quickly captured the first trench. From here, they fought their way forward and successfully captured the second trench. Despite the intense fire, they leapt from the second trench and went looking for the third and final trench where they could finally seek shelter. But there was no third trench. Meanwhile, the Germans had fought their way back into the first and second trenches, and by now the ANZACs were out in the open. They dived into bomb craters and filled sand bags with mud, anything to protect them from the deadly machine-gun fire. Here they lay until night fell, when they slowly tried to crawl back past the German trenches to the Australian line. The British High Command did not allow the rescue of wounded men in the open, in case the rescuers themselves should become wounded. The Australians disobeyed. They could not leave their mates stranded and calling for help. One officer walked across the battlefield and made a truce with the Germans. He even offered himself as a prisoner while his men tried to find all the Australian wounded. In the 27 hours after the Australians first attacked the German trenches, 5533 ANZACs had been killed or wounded. This was twice as many casualties as the landing at Gallipoli.\n\n**“A place so terrible...”**\n\nA section of the Western Front called the Somme, named after the river flowing through the area, was described by one ANZAC in August 1916 as “a place so terrible that a raving lunatic could never have imagined it”. In the middle of the Somme was a township called Pozières (Pozzy-air) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), which was built on one of the few high points in the area. Whoever held the ridge could see everything the enemy was doing. The British had tried to capture Pozières, and in one day alone suffered 60,000 casualties. The ANZACs were chosen to relieve the British, and were ordered to continue the attacks.\n\nThe Australians launched seven bloody attacks on the German defences over a six-week period. They concentrated on two main strong points, Gibraltar and the Windmill.\n\nOn 4 August 1916, the ANZACs finally captured the ridge line and what little was left of the town.\n\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400693/v2lhzg70r7tvummf9snr.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM E532)**\n\nOne out of every two ANZACs who fought here at the Somme became a casualty. In all they lost more than 22,000 men. Through their determination and courage, and in the most dreadful conditions, the ANZACs had proven themselves capable of doing the impossible. Unfortunately this was not the last time the British High Command would expect the impossible from the ANZACs.\n\nThe Australians who fought in the First World War never forgot the experience. The war changed their lives. But it also changed the lives of the many French and Belgian civilians who lived in the towns the ANZACs fought to save. In fact, they promised never to forget the role the ANZACs played in gaining their freedom.\n\nIn 1917, the French village of Bullecourt (Bull-cor) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400774/tikpwgipmsqj9bc6o2wb.pdf) sat in the middle of the Hindenburg Line – a mass of barbed wire joining concrete block houses and trenches. In some places the wire was 100 metres thick, and no Army had yet been able to break through it.\n\nOn the night of 11 April 1917 the Australians attacked the Germans in Bullecourt. The ANZACs had no artillery, and the tanks that were supposed to break through the wire broke down or bogged in the snow-covered ground. Major Percy Black, who was leading part of the attack, called to his men: “Come on boys, bugger the tanks!” and charged towards the wire. His men leapt through with him, and fought their way into the German trenches. They were the first soldiers to break through the Hindenburg line. Proudly they looked for Major Black. But he lay dead on the wire.\n\n**“N’oublions jamais l’Australie” (never forget Australia)**\n\nSo many ANZACs had been killed in the attack that only a handful of men were left alive to hold the trenches. The Germans realised this, and counter-attacked on three sides. Overwhelmed, the ANZACs were forced to withdraw. The only order given was to “fight it out like Australians”. The ANZACs returned three weeks later, and again captured the German trenches. For two weeks they survived vicious counter-attacks until the Germans finally gave in. When the smoke cleared from the battlefield, 10,000 Australians had been killed or wounded trying to save this small French village. In 1918, the Germans planned one final great offensive in an effort to win the war. At first the Allies were taken by surprise, and the Germans captured many towns and soon were within sight of the town of Amiens. The British High Command feared that if Amiens were captured, the war may be lost. The ANZACs were raced back from Belgium as ‘storm troops’ – special fighting soldiers who would be put into battle where they were needed most. At first, the ANZACs fought at Dernancourt (Dern-an-cor) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), a town on the road to Amiens, where 4000 Australians beat off an attack by 25,000 Germans.\n\nNext the Germans attacked the French village of Villers-Bretonneux (Bret-on-er) [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), after first using poisonous [gas](/gassed-last-night) and artillery. When night fell, the ANZACs stormed from their trenches and counter-attacked. A British General, who himself had won a Victoria Cross for bravery, called the ANZACs’ attack “perhaps the greatest individual feat of the war”.\n\nThe ANZACs then had to enter the village and fight from house to house. Finally, Australian and French flags were raised over Villers-Bretonneux. The ANZACs stopped to bury their dead – 1200 Australians had been killed saving the village. It was not until they were putting the date on some makeshift crosses that they realised the date – it was ANZAC Day 1918, three years to the day since they had stormed ashore at Gallipoli.\n\nThe Australian flag is still flown at Villers-Bretonneux. It flies atop the Australian National Memorial, on which is listed the names of the 10,982 Australians killed in France who have no known grave. The French have called the main road through Villers-Bretonneux, Rue de Melbourne. The town has a restaurant called Restaurant le Kangarou, and the school, called Victoria College, was built from the donations of Victorian school children in the 1920s. Above every blackboard are the words “N’oublions jamais l’Australie” – never forget Australia.\n\nClick [here](/v-is-for-villers-bretonneux-bret-on-er) for a little more information about Villers-Bretonneux, including a picture of the War Memorial and cemetery\n\nIn May 1918, the ANZACs were finally commanded by one of their own. The officer chosen was General Sir John Monash. Monash had seen too many ANZACs killed, and was determined that the Australians were from now on were to be used properly.\n\nIn his first battle, at a place called le Hamel [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541400638/lrj2iubjz7uogzfq2mki.pdf), Monash used aircraft, tanks and artillery to soften the enemy before he sent in the ANZACs. He also rehearsed the attack time and time again. Monash had planned it to last 90 minutes. After 93 minutes, his men had taken 1500 prisoners, caused 2000 German casualties and captured nearly 180 machine guns. But perhaps his best attack took place at Mont St Quentin [ACROBAT MAP](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541401071/uj3dvx0h8e97fjthkmhq.pdf), where the Germans held several thousand of their best men in reserve. The German General had decided that no one would be foolish enough to attack the hill, but just in case ordered his best-trained units to hold “to the death”. With less than a thousand men who had already been in combat for nearly three weeks, Monash planned his greatest attack. The ANZACs stormed the hill from three directions, and in two days had not only secured the hill, but had also captured 2500 prisoners. Victoria Crosses were awarded to another seven ANZACs for this action. It was to be the last great fight of their war.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Chauvel. In August, as part of the British and allied forces, the Division defeated a Turkish advance to Romani, and forced the enemy back to the line Gaza-Beersheba.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541404131/oyiscfu3sanfkasyukbi.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM B01507)**\n\nDuring 1917 the Division was involved in the initial battles for Gaza and in the capture of Beersheba, where the Light Horse, armed only with rifles and bayonets, acted as cavalry. In August the Desert Mounted Corps was formed, consisting of the ANZAC Mounted Division (1st, 2nd Light Horse and New Zealand Brigades), Australian Mounted Division (3rd, 4th Light Horse and 5th Yeomanry Brigades) and the Yeomanry Division.\n\nAfter playing a prominent part in the capture of Jerusalem in December, the Corps was withdrawn to rest. However, the German ‘Michael’ offensive in March 1918 caused many British troops, including most of the Yeomanry Division, to be redeployed to France. Nevertheless, the Corps defeated a determined attack in April by the German Asia Corps at Abu Telluk in the Jordan Valley. During September the Corps played an important part in the advance to Haifa and Semakh, and on 1 October entered Damascus. Turkey signed an armistice at the end of that month, by which time Corps units had reached Aleppo.\n\n*The above text is taken from the booklet The Australian Army - A Brief History.*\n\nMore Information:\n\n[Australian Light Horse - Historic Battles of WW1](http://alh-research.tripod.com/Light_Horse/index.blog/1881801/battles-where-australians-fought-18991920/)\n",

      "content": "In the 1860s the self governing Australian colonies established naval forces to assist in the provision of the defence of the colonies. After Federation these colonial naval forces came under the control of the new Commonwealth government. Some ten years later the Royal Australian Navy came into being and the first fleet unit, led by the battlecruiser HMAS AUSTRALIA, arrived in Sydney Harbour. A year later this young navy was to undergo its baptism of fire.\n\nWith the outbreak of war the Royal Australian Navy’s first task was to protect Australia’s ports, shipping and trade routes. As part of securing Australia’s maritime frontiers the RAN took part in the first amphibious assault of the war when it played a major role in the capture of the German colonies in the Pacific. During this period the submarine the AE1 was lost on September 14 1914, off the coast of Rabaul, with all hands.\n\nAfter this operation the ships of the RAN began the vital role of convoy escort. It was whilst escorting a convoy that the light cruiser HMAS SYDNEY was detached to investigate the sighting of a strange warship. This ship turned out to be the German light cruiser EMDEN. In the ensuing battle SYDNEY destroyed the EMDEN and thus won the RAN’s first battle.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541405986/oufn52hu9gyr5mrdjmmj.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

(AWM A01587)**\n\nThe RAN also played a supporting role in the Gallipoli campaign. On the peninsular the RAN Bridging Train provided vital service to the troops as well as being the last Australians to leave Gallipoli. The submarine AE2 played a dramatic role in the Gallipoli campaign, penetrating the ‘Narrows’ and sinking an enemy cruiser. She was eventually scuttled by her crew after suffering battle damage. The crew members were captured and spent the next three and a half years in a Turkish prison camp. Four died while prisoners.\n\n[More about the commander of the AE2, and its role in the Gallipoli campaign](/ww1-lt-cdr-henry-stoker)\n\n[More about the AE2 (RAN website)](http://www.navy.gov.au/4_history/shp_ae2.htm)\n\nText above courtesy of the [Royal Australian Navy](http://www.navy.gov.au/4_history/navalhistory.htm)\n\n\n",

      "content": "One of the least publicized of all Army services is the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps, which has given 100 years of dedicated work to caring for Australian servicemen in times of war and its aftermath.\n\nThe history of the Corps dates back to 1898 when a small nursing service was formed in Sydney. It consisted of one Lady Superintendent and twenty four nurses. The first actual service of nurses was during the Boer War (1898-1903).\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541406875/whe3g81ah4zzbmtt9qfc.png)\n\nLike to copy this image? Please click [here](/awm-images) first\n\n**An Australian Army nurse in England during World War 1. (AWM H07534)**\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, the Australian Government raised the first Australian Imperial Force for overseas service. The nurses to staff the medical units, which formed an integral part of the AIF, were recruited from the Australian Army Nursing Service Reserve and from the civil nursing profession.\n\nSenior Officers were more inclined to have trained male soldiers in preference to female nurses. Major General Howse (Director of Medical Services) has been quoted as saying that “the female nurse (as a substitute for the fully trained male nursing orderly) did little toward the actual saving of life in war... although she might promote a more rapid and complete recovery”. General Howse was speaking at a time when the contribution of the Nursing Service to the treatment of the wounded soldiers, at an early stage, had yet to be recognized by the Australian authorities.\n\nThe first draft of Sisters in the Australian Army Nursing Services (AANS) left Australia in September 1914; and throughout the war, the Nursing Service served wherever Australian troops were sent, and numerous other countries besides these. Most also served in British hospitals in various theatres of war.\n\nThey served in places such as Burma, India, The Persian Gulf, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France and England.\n\nThe record of service for these Sisters is a brilliant one, and one which set a very high standard for all who were to follow. The following statistics are noteworthy:\n\n- more than 2286 nurses served overseas\n- more than 423 served in Australia\n- 25 died\n- at least 388 were decorated (seven Military Medals were awarded to Australian Nurses for their courage under fire).\n\nAn example of one nurse's experience under fire is from Sister Kelly’s diary from a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front....\n\n“The noise was so terrific, and the concussion so great that I was thrown to the ground and had no idea where the damage was. I flew through the chest and abdo wards and called out: ‘are you alright boys?’ ‘don’t bother about us’ was the general cry.”\n\nAll the hospitals lights were out and there was a faint moon, but the sky overhead was full of searchlights and fragments from the bursting anti-aircraft artillery. She passed the cook running for an adjacent paddock, swearing hard and complaining that the bombs had put his fire out.\n\nRunning on, she suddenly fell headlong into a bomb crater...\n\n“I shall never forget the awful climb on hands and feet out of that hole that was about five feet deep with greasy clay and blood (although I did not know then that it was blood). A bomb had fallen directly alongside the pneumonia ward (pre-antibiotic).”\n\nThe tent had collapsed on forty six stretcher cases inside...\n\n“though I shouted, nobody answered me, or I could hear nothing for the roar of planes and artillery. I seemed to be the only living thing about.”\n\nShe raced back to the tent and was shortly joined by the badly shaken Padre, who went off to get help (after urging her to take cover). She ignored the advice and again tried to get into the tent. Grabbing hold of a handle under the fly she tried to drag a stretcher free. The patient was dead, and the splintered handle came away in her hand, throwing her backwards into the crater again.\n\n“I cannot remember what came next, or what I did, except that I kept calling for the orderly to help me and thought he was funking, but the poor boy had been blown to bits. Somebody got the tent up, and when I got to the delirious pneumonia patient, he was crouched on the ground at the back of the stretcher. He took no notice of me when I asked him to return to bed, so I leaned across the stretcher and put one arm around and tried to lift him in. I had my right arm under a leg, which I thought was his, but when I lifted I found to my horror that it was a loose leg with a boot and a puttee on it. It was one of the orderly’s legs which had been blown off and had landed on the patient’s bed. The next day they found the trunk about 20 yards away.”\n\nTo put into some perspective the workloads and consequent stresses these nurses endured, consider:\n\nDuring the First World War, a one thousand bed hospital, in Cairo, completely under tentage, without any floor covering was staffed by 1 Matron, 15 Sisters and 30 Staff Nurses with male medical orderlies from the Australian Army Medical Corps.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541406948/o1du79fgrooyij8z7gek.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Two members of the nursing staff of the 14th Australian General Hospital (14AGH) and two patients (from a photograph donated by J. Scott-Findlay). (AWM P0036/09/14)**\n\nIn 1917, in France, the hospital had to be extended to 2,000 beds during a “heavy rush.”\n\nCompare this to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1990... 700 beds and a staff of 670 nurses, excluding administration and education.\n\nActing under such adverse conditions, these ladies proved themselves to be of awesome dedication, courage and spirit, and truly professional.\n\nText contributed by Major Roslyn Bell RAANC",

The task of this force was initially to enforce UN sponsored sanctions against Iraq.\n\nThe first Australian vessels committed, the frigates HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide, sailed from Sydney on 13 August 1990, followed shortly afterward by the replenishment tanker HMAS Success. Because her integral air defence capability was inadequate, HMAS Success was allocated eight soldiers equipped with the RBS70 anti-aircraft weapon system from the Australian Army's 16th Air Defence Regiment.\n\nOn arrival in the Gulf in early September 1990, the Australian element of the MNNF immediately commenced operations in the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz where the two frigates were involved, with allied forces, in the interception of vessels proceeding into the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541057283/qqf4zrhh8jb8pzdcsdic.jpg)\n\nOn 29 November 1990 the UN, in the face of Iraq's unyielding attitude, passed Resolution 678 which gave authority to member states \"to use all necessary means\" against Iraq unless it withdrew from Kuwait by 15 January 1991.\n\nFor the next phase of the operation the three RAN vessels in the MNNF were replaced, in early December 1990, by the destroyer HMAS Brisbane, the frigate HMAS Sydney and the largest ship in the RAN's fleet, the 40,870 tonne replenishment ship HMAS Westralia. The Australian vessels entered the Persian Gulf as part of the largest fleet of warships since World War 2. Deployment in the Gulf was necessary to support the huge allied ground force now assembling in Saudi Arabia. Brisbane and Sydney were employed as part of the fleet's anti-air warfare screen.\n\nOperation Desert Storm, the allied operation designed to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait, started its offensive phase early in the morning of 17 January 1991 with massive air attacks on selected targets.\n\nOn 25 January 1991 HMAS Success departed for Australia; she was replaced by HMAS Westralia on 3 February. A RAN Clearance Diving Team arrived in the operational area on 30 January 1991 and was employed in preparation for a planned amphibious assault on the beaches of Kuwait. It subsequently cleared mines from ports and the open sea, and surveyed wrecked shipping.\n\nThe ground phase opened on 24 February 1991 and met with immediate and overwhelming success, defeating the Iraqi forces and forcing them to evacuate Kuwait by 28 February 1991.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Storm 40 members of the Australian Task Group Medical Support Element served in the US hospital ship USNS Comfort. In addition, a number of Australians of all three services served in the ground phase of the operation because the US and UK units to which they were posted were involved. Throughout Australia's involvement, the RAAF provided air transport support.\n\nAlthough hostilities had ceased with the capitulation of the Iraqi government, within Iraq turmoil erupted with a revolt of a dissident Kurdish minority. The Iraqis put down the revolt which resulted in a massive flight of Kurdish refugees. In a response to calls for help, Australia sent, on 16 May 1991, a 75-strong Army contingent of medical, dental, preventative medicine and field engineer teams.\n\nAustralia's involvement in the aftermath of the Gulf War continued until 1993, primarily in sanctions enforcement duty.\n\nThe above adapted from George Odger's Diggers - The Australian Army, Navy and Air Force in Eleven Wars from 6 June 1944 to 1994.",

      "content": "The Australians spent two winters in the trenches on the Western Front, 1916-1917 and 1917-1918. Each seemed an eternity. Unaccustomed to the iciness and length of Continental winters the men suffered terribly. During the winter of 1916-17 more than 20,000 Australians were evacuated with exhaustion, frostbite or trench feet.\n\nSergeant R.A. McInnes, after a night on a shelf cut into the side of a trench, wrote, “When I woke I was terribly cold. My feet protruded from my overcoat and the caked mud on my big legging-boots were covered with white frost.”\n\nCorporal A.G. Thomas wrote, “God, I cannot describe the horrors of last night. We just fell down and slept, rain and all, and shells falling all about us but we were too exhausted to bother, we didn’t mind if we were killed, it was terrible.”\n\nAfter fitful sleep, men awoke before dawn to find their eyelids frozen shut and even their lips stuck together. Frozen ground was preferable to the mud but some men broke limbs when they slipped on the icy surfaces. Shells were more dangerous exploding on hard ground than in mud.\n\nThe Germans had deeper, warmer dugouts but they too suffered in the winter and on many occasions Australians and Germans climbed onto their respective parapets where they stamped about and exercised to warm their frozen bodies. Each side solved the problem of orders to “be aggressive” by ignoring each other.\n\nEven in the relative comfort of billets life was hard. Ungloved hands were numb in a few seconds, boots need warming before being put on, bread could not be cut with a knife and boiling tea being rushed from the cookhouse froze within 20 paces.\n\nIn the trenches, the cold was so demoralising that rational thought was no longer possible and Australians prayed to be wounded, the only honourable escape from the torture of winter. Some exposed themselves to shellfire, risking death in the hope of a wound, which in any case could lead to dreadful privations before they reached hospital.\n\n“Australian boys shouldn’t be expected to live like this,” a soldier wrote home in early 1917.",

Their first major use of gas occurred on 22 April 1915 when they released chlorine from pressure cylinders in the Ypres Salient. The clouds of greenish vapour took the British and French by surprise.\n\nChoking and vomiting, many British and French troops fled in panic, leaving a five-kilometre gap in the defences. The Germans, unaware of their success, failed to exploit it. Soldiers were advised to hold a cloth soaked in urine over their mouth and nose; the ammonia in the urine neutralised the chlorine.\n\nAustralians at ANZAC were given pads impregnated with bicarbonate of soda to be tied over the mouth and nose. While still at ANZAC they were issued with hoods impregnated with hyposulphate of soda, but they were never necessary. The hypohelmets, as the Australians called them, were useless against phosgene mixed with chlorine, which the Germans used at the end of 1915.\n\nSoon after the AIF reached France in spring 1916 they were issued with a box respirator which filtered the gases. Worn on the chest, it was connected to the face piece by a rubber tube. Separate goggles protected the eyes against tear gas. A respirator developed at Melbourne University early in 1915 influenced the development of the effective box respirator which all British and Empire troops had by 1917.\n\nThe British caught up with German development and from 1916 both sides increasingly used gas-filled shells, fired from guns, mortars and spring-loaded projectors. In mid-1917 the Germans fired mustard gas, dichlorethyl sulphate, known as yellow cross because the shells were so marked. More like an oil and odourless, it took Allied troops by surprise, especially as its worst effects, severe skin blistering and serious lung congestion, did not appear for several hours. Mustard gas remained potent for weeks in mud and heavy soil.\n\nBy March 1918, before any attack, the Germans fired mustard gas on the flanks of the area selected for attack, to block support, and a less lethal, low-persistency gas on the front, so that the German attackers themselves would not be badly affected.\n\nThey often masked a mustard gas attack with high-explosive shells as well as sneezing gas - chemically diphenyl chlorarsine, or blue cross in soldiers’ talk - which made it difficult to keep the respirators on. The Australians had to wear masks throughout a bombardment and few could sleep with them on.\n\nThe Germans drenched back areas with mustard gas and Australian casualties were sometimes heavy. For instance, after heavy gassing the 4th Division’s artillery was withdrawn on 25 October 1917. In October and November that year 1,313 gunners became casualties and 20 of them quickly died.\n\nThousands of Australians were affected by gas and about 200 died from it - a small number considering the overall casualties. Mustard gas caused the majority of gas cases. It stripped the mucous membrane from the bronchial tubes and caused pain beyond endurance. Most sufferers had to be strapped to their beds and death took up to five weeks. Chlorine, phosgene and chloropicrin damaged the respiratory organs. Each gas had its ghastly effects. Severe chlorine gassing led to slow death by asphyxiation. The Diggers said that chlorine smelt like a mixture of pineapple and pepper, phosgene like rotten fish.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, neither the AIF’s best known expert in anti-gas procedures, Captain A.L. Rossiter, Gas Officer of the 4th Division, nor anybody else found a protection against mustard gas which fell on the soldier’s skin.",

        "content": "From its inception in 1916, the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has assumed the responsibility for educating the nation’s youth about the origins of ANZAC Day and for imparting the enduring lessons of self-sacrifice, mateship, perseverance, courage, devotion to duty and fidelity in the face of overwhelming odds that sprang from example of the men who fought at Gallipoli on the 25th day of April 1915, and which has been demonstrated ever after by those who serve their nation in time of war and peace.\n\nTo that end, an essay competition was conducted in 2015 to invite school students to express “What ANZAC Day Means To Me”.\n\n### ANZAC ESSAYS WIN TRIP OF A LIFETIME\n\n**The 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 2015 will always hold a very special place in the hearts and minds of two lucky children from Outback Queensland.**\n\nAiden Webster and Grace Peskett, both from Cunnamulla in south-western Queensland, entered an ANZAC Day research and essay competition conducted via Paroo Shire Council’s Cunnamulla Library.\n\nLibrarian, Tammy Hickey — assisted by teacher, Marg McLaren — saw this competition as a way to teach a younger generation all about the courage and sacrifices of our soldiers in a time when the world was at war.\n\nStudents were asked to research the events that inspired the legend of the ANZACs, to complete a quiz and write a 200-word essay entitled, “What ANZAC Day Means to Me”.\n\nAiden and Grace were judged the winners and their very strong family ties to World War I were amply demonstrated with their respective entries.\n\nA trip to Brisbane was the prize. And what a prize it was! With the help of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee each attended the Brisbane ANZAC Day Dawn Service and lay a wreath before witnessing just how the city honours The Fallen and holds dear all those who continue to defend our nation’s freedom.\n\nExtras on the trip included attending the Cosentino show at QPAC and meeting him after the show; enjoying a performance of Cirque Du Soleil; a lunchtime river cruise; a tour of the State Library of Queensland's Distant Lines exhibition — including a “white gloves” tour of war memorabilia; and a visit to the Amberley Aviation Heritage display.\n\n“Aiden and Grace met so many inspiring people during their Brisbane visit and will take many longlasting and cherished memories back to their family, friends and community in Cunnamulla,” Ms Hickey said.\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/qnwgwzfsfiimu3vegweh.pdf)\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/ttdawytaho67o3t3aetd.pdf)\n\n**In Pictures --**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468813/yogxkvbaaipdig6agfki.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace with ADCC President Arthur Burke OAM**\n\n\n![Aiden and Grace](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541468854/jecefa7rjwqxlp2nb8rk.png)\n\n**Aiden and Grace after Wreath Laying**\n<div class=\"list-group list-group-flush\">\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Themes</strong> -- Themes collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/themes\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Wars</strong> -- Collection of Wars history page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/wars\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Interactives</strong> -- Interactives collection page..</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/interactives\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Memorials</strong> -- Learn about some of the many memorials erected in Australia and other countries honouring Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/war-memorials\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Medals</strong> - A display of some of the medals awarded to Australian service personnel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/medals\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 px-0 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9\"><p><strong>Classroom Activities</strong> - A selection of activities for upper primary and secondary pupils.

It marks its wearer as one possessing supreme courage, a disregard for danger and complete devotion to duty.\n\nThe Victoria Cross (VC) was instituted on 29 January 1856 and was made retrospective from 1 August 1854.\n\nPrior to the Crimean War, there was no recognised gallantry medal, but the individual deeds in that war made the creation of such an award, available to officers and men alike, necessary.\n\nThe Victoria Cross, according to the Instituting Royal Warrant establishing rules and ordinances governing its bestowal, shall only be awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. 525 Monday 4 February 1991, the Victoria Cross took its place as the highest Australian award in the Australian System of Honours and Awards. It may be awarded to members of the Defence Force or other persons determined by the Minister of State for Defence. Bars are awarded for further similar acts of bravery. The Victoria Cross may also be awarded posthumously and recipients are entitled to use the letters VC after their names.\n\nThe design remains identical in every way to the British award, a Maltese Cross in bronze adorned by a crown surmounted by a crowned lion, the emblem of the British royal family, in the centre, with a scroll bearing the inscription, ‘For Valour’. On the reverse is inscribed the date of the action. The name and regiment of the holder are inscribed on the back of the suspension bar. The ribbon is red for all Services, although until July 1918, the Royal Navy used the blue ribbon.\n\n\n![albert jacka victoria cross](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541482901/qiovmg4txmaseivnnstm.png)\n\n**The medal ribbon group of Albert Jacka VC. The Victoria Cross ribbon is at the left from the viewer's perspective.**\n\nWhen worn, the VC takes precedence over all other awards, and is positioned to the far left of any medal group (as seen by the viewer - see image above).\n\nThe Cross has, from the first, been made by Messrs. Hancock, London jewellers and is hand fashioned. The metal used is taken from the guns captured from the Russians at Sebastopol during the Crimean War 1854-56.\n\nThe glorious fellowship of the Victoria Cross remains unique, it has no order nor chapel. The insignia is a small bronze cross costing a few dollars. It is confined to no caste, imposes no religious requirement nor colour bar. In the words of the Warrant ‘Neither rank nor long service, nor wounds, nor any other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of conspicuous bravery’ shall entitle a man to the award. The Cross has been granted to 13 persons of non-British origin, including three Danes, a German, a Swiss, a Belgian and one Ukrainian.\n\nThe first presentation of the new decoration was made by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857, when 62 sailors and soldiers received the award. The Prince Consort conceived the idea, but the Queen herself was personally responsible for much of the rest. She altered ‘For the Brave’ to ‘For Valour’ and ordered that the Cross should be awarded only ‘to those officers and men who have served us in the presence of the enemy.’\n\nThe first Australian to earn the Victoria Cross was Captain (later Sir Neville) Howse for rescuing a wounded man on 24 July 1900 while serving as an officer of the NSW Army Medical Corps during the South African War 1899-1902 (Boer War). As at March, 2002, the youngest Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross was Private JWA Jackson VC, who was 18 years 9 months.\n\nPrior to 1975, Australian service personnel were awarded gallantry, bravery and distinguished service awards under the Imperial system. Included in the new award system was the Victoria Cross for Australia (VC).\n\nOn 2 September 2008, TROOPER MARK GREGOR DONALDSON WAS AWARDED THE FIRST VICTORIA CROSS FOR AUSTRALIA for most conspicuous acts of gallantry in action in a circumstance of great peril in Afghanistan.\n\nFor more information about Trooper Donaldson go to\n\n[www.defence.gov.au/special_events/TPR_markDonaldson.htm](http://www.defence.gov.au/special_events/TPR_markDonaldson.htm)\n\n**More information:**\n\n[Lone Pine and The Nek](lone-pine-and-the-nek) (on this site).

It marks its wearer as one possessing supreme courage, a disregard for danger and complete devotion to duty.\n\nThe Victoria Cross (VC) was instituted on 29 January 1856 and was made retrospective from 1 August 1854.\n\nPrior to the Crimean War, there was no recognised gallantry medal, but the individual deeds in that war made the creation of such an award, available to officers and men alike, necessary.\n\nThe Victoria Cross, according to the Instituting Royal Warrant establishing rules and ordinances governing its bestowal, shall only be awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. 525 Monday 4 February 1991, the Victoria Cross took its place as the highest Australian award in the Australian System of Honours and Awards. It may be awarded to members of the Defence Force or other persons determined by the Minister of State for Defence. Bars are awarded for further similar acts of bravery. The Victoria Cross may also be awarded posthumously and recipients are entitled to use the letters VC after their names.\n\nThe design remains identical in every way to the British award, a Maltese Cross in bronze adorned by a crown surmounted by a crowned lion, the emblem of the British royal family, in the centre, with a scroll bearing the inscription, ‘For Valour’. On the reverse is inscribed the date of the action. The name and regiment of the holder are inscribed on the back of the suspension bar. The ribbon is red for all Services, although until July 1918, the Royal Navy used the blue ribbon.\n\n\n![albert jacka victoria cross](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541482901/qiovmg4txmaseivnnstm.png)\n\n**The medal ribbon group of Albert Jacka VC. The Victoria Cross ribbon is at the left from the viewer's perspective.**\n\nWhen worn, the VC takes precedence over all other awards, and is positioned to the far left of any medal group (as seen by the viewer - see image above).\n\nThe Cross has, from the first, been made by Messrs. Hancock, London jewellers and is hand fashioned. The metal used is taken from the guns captured from the Russians at Sebastopol during the Crimean War 1854-56.\n\nThe glorious fellowship of the Victoria Cross remains unique, it has no order nor chapel. The insignia is a small bronze cross costing a few dollars. It is confined to no caste, imposes no religious requirement nor colour bar. In the words of the Warrant ‘Neither rank nor long service, nor wounds, nor any other circumstance or condition whatsoever, save the merit of conspicuous bravery’ shall entitle a man to the award. The Cross has been granted to 13 persons of non-British origin, including three Danes, a German, a Swiss, a Belgian and one Ukrainian.\n\nThe first presentation of the new decoration was made by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857, when 62 sailors and soldiers received the award. The Prince Consort conceived the idea, but the Queen herself was personally responsible for much of the rest. She altered ‘For the Brave’ to ‘For Valour’ and ordered that the Cross should be awarded only ‘to those officers and men who have served us in the presence of the enemy.’\n\nThe first Australian to earn the Victoria Cross was Captain (later Sir Neville) Howse for rescuing a wounded man on 24 July 1900 while serving as an officer of the NSW Army Medical Corps during the South African War 1899-1902 (Boer War). As at March, 2002, the youngest Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross was Private JWA Jackson VC, who was 18 years 9 months.\n\nPrior to 1975, Australian service personnel were awarded gallantry, bravery and distinguished service awards under the Imperial system. Included in the new award system was the Victoria Cross for Australia (VC).\n\nOn 2 September 2008, TROOPER MARK GREGOR DONALDSON WAS AWARDED THE FIRST VICTORIA CROSS FOR AUSTRALIA for most conspicuous acts of gallantry in action in a circumstance of great peril in Afghanistan.\n\nFor more information about Trooper Donaldson go to\n\n[www.defence.gov.au/special_events/TPR_markDonaldson.htm](http://www.defence.gov.au/special_events/TPR_markDonaldson.htm)\n\n**More information:**\n\n[Lone Pine and The Nek](lone-pine-and-the-nek) (on this site).

Fighting was now going on in the gullies and ridges a kilometre inland.\n\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541483396/fyk8pvukljtdxhu5qefx.png)\n\nLike to copy this image? Please click [here](/awm-images) first\n\n** (Above) The cramped conditions of trench warfare. (AWM A00907)**\n\n**Somehow the wounded soldiers had to be evacuated to the field hospitals at ANZAC Cove – this was the job of the stretcher bearers. One stretcher bearer named Simpson used a donkey to help him carry the wounded men back to safety. Week after week, Simpson and his donkey, Duffy, braved the Turkish bombs and bullets to rescue wounded ANZACs scattered amongst the steep and rocky hills of Gallipoli.**\n\nOne day Duffy walked down to the beach carrying a wounded soldier. Simpson was nowhere to be seen. His mates went looking for him, only to find he had been killed. He was only 22 years old. The man with the donkey was known by many ANZACs who fought at Gallipoli. Many owed their lives to his courage, and many more were impressed by his bravery.\n\nEvery soldier at Gallipoli had stories to tell of the fighting, but two battles stand out because they were so fierce. One was fought at a place the Australians called Lone Pine. The ridge line was given its name because when the Turks were making roofs for their trenches, they chopped down every tree except one.\n\nIn the nervous moments before the attack, men moved amongst the trenches, looking for friends, brothers or fathers. If they were about to go into battle they wanted to be with their mates. On hearing the signal to attack, the ANZACs jumped out of their trenches and raced across no-man's-land – the land that separated them from the Turks. When they reached the Turkish trenches, they had to fight their way through logs and mud to get underground. When they finally broke through, there were so many soldiers they could not raise their rifles to fire. Much of the battle was with bare hands. It took two days of the most horrible fighting before Lone Pine was captured by the ANZACs. \n\nThe [Victoria Cross](/the-victoria-cross-main) is awarded for acts of the highest bravery. Of the nine Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians at Gallipoli, seven were earned at Lone Pine. \n\n\n![victoria cross](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541483592/vcgrqjqh4rysfmafu4xs.png)\n\n**(Above) The Victoria Cross. **\n\nThe Australians had lost 2273 men, and the Turks had lost at least 4000. The battle had taken place in an area the size of two soccer fields.",

Unlike today, most Australians felt they were more British than Australian. Because of this loyalty, the man who was to become Australia’s next Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, promised that *“Australia will stand by to defend (Great Britain) to our last man and our last shilling”*.\n\n[Men rushed to join the long queues at army barracks around Australia](/volunteer). All had different reasons for wanting to enlist. Many believed they had no choice but to protect England from invasion. Others thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel. And many just didn’t want to miss out on something so exciting. “*Don’t worry,*” they told their mothers, wives and girlfriends. “*It will all be over by Christmas.*” The first ships that took the soldiers off to war were filled to overflowing. Many of the men were from the country and some had never seen the ocean before. But they soon became used to it, as they spent many weeks at sea. When they finally reached land, many were disappointed they were not in England. The Generals had decided there were already too many soldiers in the British training camps, so the Australians were sent to Egypt, where they finished their training.\n\nThe Generals had also decided that these soldiers needed a name. They were to be known as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, or ANZACs.\n\nTurkey (then called the Ottoman Empire) was on the side of Germany in the First World War. The British Generals decided they could defeat Turkey if they could capture the capital city called Istanbul (then called Constantinople).\n\nAfter the Turks sank several British and French ships in the Dardanelles, it was decided that the only way to capture Constantinople would be to land soldiers near a place called Gallipoli. The closest soldiers were the ANZACs, who had completed their training in Egypt. The Australians were getting restless, and after coming all this way they wanted to see how good they were in battle. They were soon to get their chance.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1543827851/gxpugavas01eyxnphyvj.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

      "content": "by **P. Andrews**\n\nThe Merchant Navy, as a Service, has no real way of displaying its capabilities. There is no compulsory wearing of uniforms, no street parades led by fine military bands, no pomp or ceremony of any sort to attract the general public or media. The only attention given to the Service is when some catastrophe or other occurs which raises the hackles of the conservationists, and this always seems to be to the detriment of the Merchant Navy.\n\nIf a warship is lost, by conflict or by dereliction of duty, we never hear the last of it. If a merchant ship is lost you seldom hear of it. I wonder how many people would consult the Lloyds list of ships lost worldwide in a single year. It runs into hundreds -- ships both large and small, many of them with the loss of all hands and leaving no trace.\n\nMerchant ships of all sizes quietly come and go. They visit ports both large and small across the world, carrying the raw materials of trade, oil and petroleum products and the manufactured goods of industry. These ships journey to and from all countries, and have been doing so for millennia. It is, however, in times of conflict that the Merchant Navy finds itself an indispensable force within the framework of military operations, and even then for safety and security reasons, a low profile is maintained.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488776/gzveoxtciutdwf3k0gyt.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Matunga carried stores, fuel and personnel of the Australian Navy and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF) to New Guinea, until she was captured and sunk by the German raiderWolf in August 1917.**\n\nIn wartime, nations with extensive global interests involved in such confrontations look towards their merchant ships for sea lift capabilities in the transportation of their military personnel, equipment and supplies to wherever -- and whenever -- they are required; to sustain them for the duration with the necessary arms and ammunition, fuel and food and all the paraphernalia of war; and then bring everyone safely back home again.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488819/u97aqxwsgec3wzmvzpij.png)\n\n**AWM H02227. Relatives and friends on the wharf farewelling Australian soldiers on their way overseas.**\n\nIt was an accepted fact of life that the Merchant Navy would go anywhere it was sent without argument. In the Boer War, it was the Merchant Navy which took all Australia’s troops to South Africa and brought them home again safely, but then there were then no submarines, enemy aircraft or mines to worry about.\n\nIn World War 1, the first person killed was a merchant seaman, when his ship, a brigantine, was sunk by gunfire from a German submarine in the North Atlantic.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488842/odk62osm9vi0yacs4tcy.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The last person to die after the cessation of hostilities with Germany was also a merchant seaman, when his ship was torpedoed in the North Atlantic three days after the war ended.\n\nFurthermore, we should not forget Atlantic Conveyor was the only British merchant ship sunk in the Falklands War but she was not the first ship sunk, for the cruiser ARA General Belgrano was sunk on 2 May and the destroyer HMS Sheffield sunk on 4 May, and others during the course of the next five weeks resulting in the death of many merchant seamen.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541488873/odear65smprxzvx8urt8.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

As such she was bombed and heavily damaged in Darwin harbour by Japanese aircraft on 19 February 1942.**\n\nIt is not generally known that all hospital ships, royal fleet auxiliaries, armed merchant cruisers and most of the so-called Woolworth carriers of World War 2 were crewed by merchant seamen who sailed under the Red Ensign (Red Duster), Blue Ensign and the White Ensign. Whether they were on passenger liners, troopships, ocean going tugs, cargo ships, cross channel ferries, or fishing boats, the merchant seamen did their job without fuss and very often largely unnoticed.\n\nMerchant ships are not built for war and merchant seamen are not trained for war, whereas naval vessels are specially designed to absorb damage from enemy attack, and their crews are highly trained in damage control and gunnery.\n\nWe in Australia and New Zealand commemorate a day which is called ANZAC Day, a day which is set aside to remember and to pay homage to our fallen comrades. This day was born out of the Gallipoli campaign, but I wonder how many people are aware of the involvement of the Merchant Navy in that campaign. The merchant ships took all of our troops to Gallipoli, and in many cases landed our troops on the beach at ANZAC Cove in the ships’ lifeboats -- manned by merchant seamen, who also came under the deadly fire from the Turkish guns.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541489062/hgnavwytgt22xeyrt8wm.png)\n\nThe WW1 troopships at anchor in Mudros Harbour, Lemnos Island.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the great majority of wounded in that campaign were taken in the ships’ lifeboats -- with merchant seamen manning the oars -- to the hospital ships which were waiting offshore. The merchant ships evacuated most of our troops from Gallipoli to Alexandria, Lemnos and Cyprus and then transported the wounded home to Australia.\n\nWho could forget the horrors of the Atlantic convoys, in ships which in most instances were completely unable to defend themselves and were at the mercy of a ruthless enemy, day and night, for anything up to a month at a time? Between 1939 and 1945, in the so-called Battle of the Atlantic, nearly 3000 Allied and neutral merchant ships were sunk by enemy action, with a heavy loss of life. Nightmare trips to Archangel and Murmansk, suffering the rigours of an Arctic winter, while under continuous enemy attack, were endured by the crews of the merchant vessels to ensure that essential war equipment, supplies and foodstuffs got through to our Russian Allies.\n\nThose very hard-fought convoys to the small but intrepid Mediterranean island of Malta, on which so much of the war in the Middle East depended: whether the ships came from Alexandria or by way of Gibraltar, they were under constant attack while trying to keep open the supply lines to the vital beleaguered garrison.\n\nIn August 1942, one of the greatest sea battles of World War 2, Operation Pedestal, was fought by 14 merchant ships and a large fleet of naval vessels throughout five days of continuous warfare -- from air and sea, as the fleet endeavoured to get essential supplies to Malta. Why have so many people not heard of this operation? Was it just another convoy of merchant ships? I can tell you this; we lost more men in those five days of fighting than Australia lost in the whole of the Vietnam War.\n\nGenerally, a convoy of say 45 ships usually had an escort of about four or five corvettes and maybe one old destroyer. To give you some idea of the importance of this convoy of 14 ships to Malta, we had an escort of two battleships, five aircraft carriers, seven cruisers, 22 destroyers, seven submarines and 14 other sundry naval vessels. Yet, despite this level of support, at the end of the five days, only five merchant ships had survived and three of them were badly damaged.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic and in the Pacific, the threat of surface raiders and submarines with their mine layers was ever present. Even Australian home waters were not safe; in WW2, 55 merchant ships were sunk by enemy action in the surrounding seas.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541489087/patgg66uihoae5nxdk0q.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The effect of a thousand pound bomb on a small merchant ship lying in Tobruk harbour.**\n\nWherever the war was being waged, merchant ships were there taking troops and essential supplies to the heart of the action. The traversing of these supply lines by these vessels and their crews, I think you will agree, was an extremely hazardous occupation. The whole maritime world was their battleground. From the moment they left port, these ships and their crews were at war, not knowing when they might be attacked, blown up or disabled in some fashion. Some statistics of the cost to the Merchant Service in World War 2 deserve some contemplation:\n\n- 4996 British and Allied ships lost\n- 62933 British and Allied merchant seamen killed in action\n- 4000 wounded\n- 5000 merchant seamen taken as prisoners of war.\n\nCompare this with the 50,758 British and Commonwealth Naval personnel killed in the war. It has been estimated that the Merchant service losses amounted to one in six, compared to the combined armed forces of one in 33. It is also worthy of note that of the total casualties of merchant seamen, only 8.25 percent were wounded but 91.75 percent killed, compared with 79 percent wounded and 21 percent killed in the armed forces.\n\nDuring the Falklands War, 43 merchant ships were taken up from trade (the first of these within two days of the outbreak of hostilities with Argentina) together with 24 Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service vessels, all manned by merchant navy personnel. Merchant ships outnumbered naval vessels in this campaign. Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, Commander-in-Chief Fleet, said: I cannot say too often or too clearly that without the merchant ships taken up from trade and those remarkable merchant seamen, this operation could not have been undertaken, and I hope this message is clearly understood by the British Nation.\n\nIn time of relative peace, merchant seamen are often confronted by the relics of war and at times are required to enter areas of unrelated conflict. These, coupled with the inherent perils of the sea, are all taken in their stride. To those who survived, there is an obligation to ensure that those who were less fortunate are not forgotten, whether they be shipmates, friends serving in other ships, or simply bound to us by the brotherhood-of-the-sea. We are proud to be known as merchant seamen.\n\nJohn Curtin, our wartime Prime Minister, said of the merchant seaman: Whenever you see a man in the street wearing the distinctive MN badge, raise your hat to him because without these gallant men the war would be lost.\n\nWinston Churchill said on 27 January 1942: But for the Merchant Navy who bring us the food and munitions of war, Britain would be in a parlous state and indeed, without them, the Army, Navy and Air Force could not operate.\n\nJohn Beasley, the wartime Minister of Supply and Shipping said on 6 March 1943:With due deference to the splendid services of the armed forces, I can say that the recent operations around New Guinea and the South Pacific would not have succeeded but for the magnificent work and courage of the Merchant Navy.\n\nHM King George VI said: The task of the Merchant Navy is no less essential to the people’s existence than that allotted to the Navy, Army and Air Force, and indeed, none of them would be able to operate without these brave men.\n\nAnd finally, in October 1945, a tribute was paid to the Merchant Navy by the British Houses of Parliament which said:\n\n<p class=\"p-3\">The Minister of War Transport has been informed by the Lord Chancellor and by the Speaker of the House of Commons of the terms of the Resolutions in identical terms passed by both Houses of Parliament without dissent on the 30th October 1945, of which he has been requested to communicate the following portion to Masters, Officers and men of the Merchant Navy.That the thanks of this House be accorded to the Officers and Men of the Merchant Navy for the steadfastness with which that maintained our stocks of food and materials; for their services in transporting men, munitions and fuel to all the battles over all the seas; and for the gallantry with which, though a civilian service, they met and fought the constant attacks of the enemy. That this House doth acknowledge the Merchant Navy with humble gratitude and the sacrifice of all those who, on land or sea or in the air, have given their lives that others today may live as free men, and its heartfelt sympathy with their relatives in their proud sorrow. We shall never forget them, we were forgotten!</p>\n\n<div class=\"p-5\"><h4 class=\"font-weight-bold m-0\">In Memoriam\nMerchant Navy 1939-1945</h4><p>No cross marks the place where now we lie\nWhat happened is known but to us\nYou asked, and we gave our lives to protect\nOur land from the enemy curse\nNo Flanders Field where poppies blow;\nNo Gleaming Crosses, row on row;\nNo Unnamed Tomb for all to see\nAnd pause -- and wonder who we might be\nThe Sailors’ Valhalla is where we lie\nOn the ocean bed, watching ships pass by\nSailing in safety now thru’ the waves\nOften right over our sea-locked graves\nWe ask you just to remember us.</p></div>\n\n**Author's Note**: When a merchant ship was sunk, the seaman’s pay stopped on the day of the sinking. He did not receive any more pay until he joined another ship. The seaman was given 30 days survivor’s leave, dated from the day his ship was sunk. This leave was unpaid. It only meant that he didn’t have to report back to the pool for 30 days. If he spent 10 or 15 days in a lifeboat, or on a life raft, that time in the boat was counted as survivor’s leave. There were many merchant seamen who joined the Navy because it was extremely short of experienced seamen. They joined under what were known as T124X and T124T agreements. These men were in naval uniforms on naval ships under the White Ensign, with naval officers and subject to naval discipline. They received naval rates of pay. At the end of the war, they were not allowed to claim any compensation or any benefits, because they were discharged as merchant seamen.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Just before the ANZACs landed at Gallipoli on the morning of 25 April 1915 an Australian submarine, the AE2 set out on an historic journey. Its mission was to force a passage up the treacherous Dardanelles Strait into the Sea of Marmara, and then, in the words of the Chief of Staff, 'Generally run amok.' Such an extraordinary order required an extraordinary captain and luckily the AE2 had such a captain, Lieutenant Commander Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker -- an Irishman.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491754/nkh8h6lm2wjlovdoeenq.png) \n\n**Lieutenant Commander Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker. Photo courtesy Fred and Elizabeth Brenchley.**\n\nHenry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker, the second son of a physician, was born in Dublin on 2 February 1885. At the age of 12 he went to England to enter a school which specialised in training boys to pass the entrance examination for the Royal Navy, which he eventually joined at 15. After three years service aboard HMS Implacable, he applied to join the fledgling submarine service. Within two years he was promoted to lieutenant and obtained his first command -- HM Submarine A10.\n\nBy 1914 he was an experienced submariner and was chosen to command AE2, one of the two new submarines built at Barrow-in-Furness for the Australian Navy. Despite the fact that the rudimentary submarines of that era had never managed to sail more than 200 miles without breaking down, the intrepid Stoker and his mixed crew of Australian and English ratings -- in company with the other Australian submarine AE1 -- set sail for Australia on 2 March 1914. On 24 May 1914, after an incredible voyage of 83 days of which 60 were at sea, the two submarines made their entrance into Sydney Harbour. They were the first submarines to travel such a distance.\n\nSoon after their arrival in Australia, the AE1 and AE2 were sent north to assist in the Australian occupation of German New Guinea. AE1 was mysteriously lost with all hands during the mission. However, Stoker and AE2 successfully returned to Australia. Immediately on his return, Stoker in his flamboyant style, bailed up the Australian Defence Minister -- behind the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives -- and talked him into sending the AE2 back to Europe to assist in the European war. Not content with doing the historic England-Australia voyage once, Stoker and the AE2 set off back to Europe in December 1914. However, he only got as far as the Mediterranean before being ordered to join the British fleet at Tenedos Island and patrol the entrance to the Dardanelles. It was the start of the Gallipoli Campaign.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491787/gfyhc5ztyezgu6hmpu43.png)\n\nLike to copy this image? Please click [here](/awm-images) first\n\n**AWM P01075.043. Port bow view of HMA Submarine AE2 on arrival at Portsmouth, England, to prepare for the voyage to Australia.**\n\nAccording to Stoker, in his gripping autobiography Straws in the Wind, he quickly 'formed the opinion that an attempt to dive a submarine right through the Dardanelles Strait and into the Sea of Marmara held sufficient chance of success to justify the attempt being made'. The psychological advantage of entering the Sea of Marmara and thereby threatening Constantinople from the sea would be enormous.\n\nHowever, the difficulties were tremendous. The Strait was thirty-five miles long with a continuous current running at five knots back into the Mediterranean. The whole area was heavily mined, and although a submarine could dive under the mines with its periscope submerged it had to remain at periscope depth in order to navigate the narrow Strait. If it cleared the minefield, the submarine would be in narrow waters, completely controlled by the Turkish Navy.\n\nDespite the fact that the British submarine, the E15, had just been lost attempting to force the Strait, Stoker badgered the Admiralty with letters requesting an opportunity to make an attempt. Finally Stoker was received by the Chief of Staff, Commodore Roger Keyes and told he would be permitted to try. Admiral Sir John De Robeck, the Vice-Admiral of the Mediterranean Fleet told Stoker that 'if you succeed there is no calculating the result it will cause, and it may well be that you have done more to finish the war than any other act accomplished'. As Michael White remarked in his book, Australian Submarines, 'these were heady words for any man to have addressed to him, let alone one such as Stoker who had already shown outstanding qualities of enterprise and daring'.\n\nAt 2.30 am on the morning of 25 April 1915, Stoker weighed anchor and set out on the attempt to run the Dardanelles Strait, which would forever assure him of a place in Australian naval history. His plan was basically simple -- travel as far as possible on the surface to conserve his limited battery power, and dive at daylight or when he reached the minefields.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491827/umbv8podwvdgz9zwm01u.png)\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491839/woallpc9gadorikkphvh.png)\n\n**The map at the top is a magnified section of the marked rectangular section of the map at bottom.**\n\nThe night of 25 April was a beautiful dark and calm night and the AE2 proceeded along at seven knots in the centre of the Strait. Suddenly they were spotted by the searchlight at Kephez and shells began to rain down. Stoker quickly submerged and passed a harrowing hour slowly creeping under the minefield. He could hear the mooring wires of the mines scraping the sides of AE2. 'Choose a wrong moment to rise for observation through the periscope and you choose a moment to hit a mine -- so choose as few of these moments as possible', Stoker dryly observed in Straws in the Wind. Rising twice in the minefield, Stoker realised he was travelling faster than he had anticipated. When he rose for the third time, he was pleased to find himself through the minefield and only three hundred yards below the famous Narrows.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541491866/ji08joah5a1chrklbmcr.png)\n\n**Artist's impression of AE2's Dardanelles journey. (Artist unknown; Royal Naval Submarine Museum, Gosport, UK). Photo courtesy Fred and Elizabeth Brenchley.**\n\nThe Turks were now well aware of the AE2's presence and soon a small cruiser and a number of destroyers were attacking the submarine. Stoker fired a torpedo which missed the cruiser but it struck and damaged one of the destroyers. Submerged and trying to escape the destroyers' attempts to ram him, Stoker hit the bottom hard and slid up to a depth of 10 feet, right under the guns of a shore-based fort. The position was perilous. AE2 was fast aground with almost half of its structure out of the water. Stoker described it 'as unpleasant as it well could be'. Luckily they were so close to the fort that the guns could not be depressed enough to hit the submarine and after a short time the efforts of the crew to refloat AE2were successful. One of the crew recorded in his diary:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">During all this the Captain remained extremely cool, for all depended on him at this stage. It is due to his coolness that I am now writing this account. Nobody knows what a terrible strain it is on the nerves to undergo anything like this, especially the Captain, as all depends on him.</p>\n\nStoker and his crew resumed their journey pursued by dozens of Turkish warships. Antisubmarine warfare was in its infancy and the only way the Turks could attack the AE2 was by trying to ram her. As long as AE2 could stay submerged, it was relatively safe. However navigating the narrow strait was impossible without frequently coming up to periscope depth to take a sighting. Whenever they lifted the periscope, the Turkish ships attempted to ram. Stoker decided to run the AE2 on to an underwater bank and sit on the bottom until dark.\n\nFor sixteen hours the dauntless Stoker and his crew sat in darkness and silence at a depth of 80 feet. When they finally rose to the surface they found themselves about half a mile from the shore in a bay above Nagara Point -- the worst of their journey was now behind them. Stoker sent a radio message back to the fleet but never received an answer, and consequently was unsure if the message had been received. He was to learn much later that the message was indeed received, and that his message was to change the course of history.\n\nThe Allied landings on the Gallipoli peninsular had been met with fierce resistance. From their position on the beach General Bridges and his staff were alarmed at the ANZACs position and requested that they be withdrawn back to the fleet. Just as Stoker's message was received, a midnight conference was being held on the flagship Queen Elizabeth to decide whether to withdraw the troops off the peninsular.\n\nA friend of Stoker's, Lieutenant Commander C G Brodie, ignored requests to keep quiet and read to the conference Stoker's message heralding AE2's success. 'The psychological impact at that precise time was momentous', Michael White said in Australian Submarines. It will never be known if they were actually going to pull the troops off Gallipoli, but after Stoker's message was read Hamilton sent his famous 'dig, dig, dig' message to the Australians:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Your news is indeed serious. But there is nothing for it but to dig yourselves right in and stick it out. It would take at least two days to re-embark you, as Admiral Thursby will explain to you. Meanwhile the Australian submarine has got up through the Narrows and has torpedoed a gunboat at Chanak. P S You have got through the difficult business. Now you have only to dig, dig, dig, until you are safe.</p>\n\nThe news of the AE2's achievement spread to the Diggers clinging to the Gallipoli cliffs and lifted their morale. A notice was stuck on a shell-shattered stump on the hillside:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">'Australian sub AE2 just through the Dardanelles. Advance Australia'.</p>\n\nMeanwhile Stoker was pressing on in AE2 towards the Sea of Marmara. He encountered two Turkish warships and fired a torpedo at the largest but was unsuccessful. After spending the night of 25-26 April on the surface, AE2 finally entered the Sea of Marmara early in the morning of 26 April. Their mission now was to prevent Turkish ships transporting troops across the Marmara to Gallipoli.\n\nSpotting a likely target Stoker fired one of his precious torpedoes but again missed. He spent the remainder of the day on the surface sailing among fishing boats and doing all he could to broadcast the arrival of an allied submarine in the Marmara. After dark, Stoker again attempted to contact the fleet by wireless but was forced to dive constantly to escape Turkish patrol vessels.\n\nAt dawn Stoker resumed the offensive and fired a torpedo at a ship which was accompanied by two destroyers. The torpedo's engine failed to start and Stoker just managed to avoid being rammed by one of the destroyers. No other ships were sighted for the rest of the day which shows that the AE2's presence was curtailing Turkish ship movements.\n\nBy the morning of the 29th, Stoker was still sailing in the Sea of Marmara and harassing any Turkish ship he could find. However, he was now down to one torpedo which he decided to keep in reserve. His plan was to sail around, be as provocative as possible, and try to fool the Turks into believing that more than one submarine had made it to the Sea.\n\nEarly on the evening of the 29th, while sailing towards Marmara Island, the crew ofAE2 was surprised to encounter another submarine. It was the British submarineE14 under the command of Captain Boyle, which had been dispatched after the Admiralty heard of Stoker's successful passage up the Strait. Boyle asked Stoker what he planned to do the next day. It had been Stoker's intention to sail to Constantinople but Boyle, being the senior officer, overruled that plan and arranged to rendezvous with Stoker the next morning. This decision would seal the fate ofAE2 and her gallant crew.\n\nWhen Stoker surfaced at the rendezvous at 10am, he observed a torpedo boat and immediately dived. For some unaccountable reason the AE2 suddenly went out of control and began rapidly to rise. The submarine shot to the surface about 100 yards from the torpedo boat which opened fire. Stoker again attempted to dive but the AE2 was out of control and began to plunge into the depths.\n\nStoker took the prescribed emergency action and arrested the descent, but nowAE2 rushed back towards the surface where it was hit by shells from the attacking boat and was holed in several places. AE2 was doomed. Stoker ordered the submarine scuttled and concentrated on saving the lives of his men.\n\nAll the crew survived and were taken prisoner, and together with Stoker spent the next three-and-a-half years as 'guests' of the Turks. Stoker escaped twice but was recaptured and endured numerous hardships in Turkish prisons.\n\nAfter repatriation he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was offered the command of a cruiser but chose to leave the Navy for a career on the stage. He appeared in a number of plays, films and television dramas. His contemporaries included Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Mills.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out Stoker rejoined the Navy, and served for the duration.\n\nThe larger-than-life Stoker died on his 81st birthday in 1966.\n\nWhile Australia takes justifiable pride in the heroism of the ANZACs, and Simpson and his donkey are part of the nation's folklore, little is known of the dauntless Henry Hugh Gordon Dacre Stoker. Yet this man sailed a submarine around the world, and pulled off one of the most daring exploits in naval history. His achievements deserve to be placed firmly in history; he caused the Turks to abandon attempts to reinforce Gallipoli by sea, and forced them to use a much more hazardous land route. His success changed the whole course of the Gallipoli Campaign. As searchers now successfully have located the sunken hull of AE2, it's time that the intrepid Stoker and his crew were awarded their place in Australian history.\n\n**References**\n\nMichael W D White, Australian Submarines: A History, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1992.\nFred and Elizabeth Brenchley, Stoker's Submarine, HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001.\nH H G D Stoker, Straws in the Wind, Herbert Jenkins, London, 1925.\n\nI wish to express my thanks to Primrose Stoker, Stoker's niece, who supplied me with many details of Stoker's life.",

      "content": "Inspired by One Man's Compassion during Wartime\n\nBy Ray Geise OAM, Chairman, Toc H Australia\n\nGreat tragedies and disasters often bring out the best in people and anyone who knows the Ypres Salient in Belgium will know the truth in this statement. During the months of October and November 1914 British forces drove a bulge into the German front line on the Western Front about 20 kilometres long and no more than five kilometres deep. This bulge was known as the Ypres Salient and was located close to and east of the historic city of Ypres. It has often been referred to as one of the most infamous killing fields on the Western Front during World War 1. It claimed over one million casualties and between late 1916 and October 1917 all five Divisions of the AIF were involved in the fierce fighting that took place there. In the Battles of Broodseinde, Menin Road, Messines and Passchendaele, thousands of Australians were killed or wounded. If there are three words which would best describe the Ypres Salient they would probably be Courage, Destruction and Death.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496239/xugftqasqm8p07flzrds.png)\n\n**Tyne Cot garden cemetery where 1,368 Australians are buried**\n\nThere was, however, one place in which those returning from the front line could find some relief from the traumas of war, and this was Talbot House in the small Belgian town of Poperinghe just 11 kilometres west of Ypres. In December 1915 Queensland born Army Chaplain, the Reverend P.B. (Tubby) Clayton opened a Soldiers Club here and right from the beginning it had a remarkable atmosphere.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496292/ri5wvvodfosprmwp2ltc.png)\n\n**Rev Dr PB Tubby Clayton CH, MC, DD.**\n\nHere is what one young soldier wrote about Talbot House:\n\n\"Through an elaborate, iron-grilled doorway I could hear the sound of laughter and music, and pushing through the door I found myself at once in a different world. It was amazing. I felt like Alice when she stepped through the looking glass. There were soldiers all round me, of course, and Army slang in the air, but in stepping across that threshold, I seemed to have left behind me all the depression and weariness of the streets outside.\n\nHere it was that war-torn men found a haven of rest - a place where they tried to forget; yes a spot where peace and quiet were actually found even amidst the noise of war. Here we found the fellowship we longed for, yet so difficult to get.\n\nThe house was, indeed, all that it professed to be - a home away from home. Army orders and army ranks were left outside. It could scarcely be otherwise, for up there in the Upper Room, General and Private knelt side by side in front of the Carpenters Bench; a room so sacred to many of us that it grows more hallowed with the passing of time.\"\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496323/wacrkxhfpz7l4qv9pj9s.png)\n\n**The Carpenters Bench (The Altar) in Talbot House today.**\n\nThe Upper Room was the Chapel and it was situated in the loft of Talbot House on the fourth floor. Over 50,000 young men used it from 1915 to 1918; it did much to recharge their spiritual batteries. One young soldier left this anonymous and moving note in the Upper Room just before he left for the front line:\n\nWill you pray earnestly for me that I may have strength given to me to do that which is right and to make an effort to help others; not so much by what I say, but by my whole life. I have wandered away very far, but I want to put things right; and the prayers of Talbot House will mean much to me.\n\nCompassion, Caring, Understanding, Fair-mindedness, Service were all ideals which were espoused by the men who knew Talbot House, and above the door which opened on to the street hung a large sign which read \"Everymans Club 1915 -?\".\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496347/od5190ibgwurtmdgd8hz.png)\n\n**Talbot House, 1915.**\n**The sign above the front door reads: \"TALBOT HOUSE 1915-? Every•Man's CLUB\".**\n\nIt is not known how many Australians went to Talbot House from 1915 to 1918, but as all five Australian divisions passed through Poperinghe on their way to the Ypres Salient there would have been many who found their way to it. Many also spent time there on their way back from the front line. Amongst those was Corporal Jim Arkell of the 7th Australian Field Ambulance and he visited the House on several occasions. He and Tubby Clayton became close friends.\n\nAnd so amidst the horrors of war an ideal was born, a lofty ideal and it found expression in a world wide movement called simply Toc H, the Army signallers code word for Talbot House.\n\nAfter the war ended all of those who had known Tubby Clayton and Talbot House decided that the ideals for which the House stood should never be lost and in 1922 the Toc H Movement received its Royal Charter. In 1923 the then Governor General of Australia, Lord Forster, wrote to Tubby Clayton saying that he and Lady Forster would like to give a Toc H Lamp in memory of their two sons who had died in the Great War. The Lamp reached Australia in 1925 and has since then been enshrined in Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle. It is the parent lamp of Toc H Australia.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496398/fkusworq3bixr2t8fq43.png)\n\n**The symbol of Toc H is a lighted lamp.**\n\nFrom 1925 to the outbreak of World War 2 Toc H spread rapidly to all Australian States and its members built a fine tradition of 'Caring for People' carrying on the ideals for which Talbot House stood. They pioneered the Blood Transfusion Service, the Junior Farmers Movement, the Royal Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme and the Camping Program for children in need or with disabilities. In Brisbane in 1926 children from the Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital were taken to the Brisbane Exhibition. (This project continues to this day and in 2000, ninety children were involved). Jim Arkell played a leading role in Toc H in Queensland for almost fifty years and for his outstanding service was awarded the MBE.\n\nDuring World War 2 many Toc H members served in the armed forces. Thus it was not uncommon to find Toc H groups in many units. In Changi prisoner of war camp there were three Toc H groups. Around Australia Toc H Services Clubs were established in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns. Tens of thousands of men and women used them, and the one in Cairns was even called Talbot House.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496422/yvtncigkbo2bixafymlc.png)\n\n**The Toc H Rushlight used by Toc H members in Changi POW Camp, 1942 - 1945.**\n\nWorld War 2 had a big impact on Toc H in Australia. Membership was reduced and many branches closed. In spite of this the movement continued and has been led by many well known Australians - Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, Senator Neville Bonner, Sir William Keys and many more. Toc H members work on the principle that although there are many welfare agencies around and although vast sums of money are spent annually on all sorts of worthwhile community projects there are still many people who are in need. The real job of any Toc H member or branch is to seek out these people and to respond to their needs.\n\nThroughout Australia Toc H members work quietly on problems like loneliness, old age and reconciliation. One major focus today is on youth and for the past fifteen years Toc H has conducted very successful Youth Leadership Training Programs around Australia. Many who have been through these programs are already in leadership roles in the community. Since 1947 Toc H Queensland has hosted the Midnight Service inside the Shrine of Remembrance, ANZAC Square, Brisbane on ANZAC Eve and in 2000 it was supported by the largest crowd since it was first held. Most of those present were under thirty years of age and many were involved in the service. Prior to the Service an evening entitled We Will Remember Them - Flanders Fields and Beyond was held and it too was very well supported.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541496444/myzlvr4q9q3gmuep50sd.png)\n\n**The garden at Talbot House today.**\n\nAnd so the Spirit of Toc H which had its roots in the darkest years of World War 1 on the Western Front lives on. Talbot House in Poperinghe continues to inspire the movement. It is the same as it was in 1915 and is visited by tens of thousands of people from all round the world every year. In a very real sense Toc H is a living memorial, not only to those who passed through the doors of Talbot House during World War 1 but also to those who have unselfishly given their lives in service to their country. There is a saying in Toc H that goes *\"Service to others is the rent we pay for our room on earth\"*.\n\n",

As the Australians advanced up a slope they encountered heavy fire from the German front line. The adjoining platoon to Axford’s was delayed by the uncut wire, suffering many casualties. Axford rushed in from the flank to assist. He jumped into the enemy trench and bombed and bayoneted the machine-gun crews, killing ten enemy and taking six prisoners. He threw the machine guns over the parapet and called the delayed platoon forward before he returned to his own platoon with which he fought for the remainder of the operation. He had previously helped lay out the assault line tapes which were within 10 metres of the enemy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">11 October 1983, Perth</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Karrakatta Crematorium, Perth, Western Australia</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Current location of the VC</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Australian War Memorial</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

His first bomb fell short, but on reaching the post he knocked one German down with his fist and threatened the others with the remaining Mills bomb. The whole party, consisting of one officer and twelve men of 137th Infantry Regiment, surrendered and Brown shepherded them back to the Australian lines. </p><p>He re-enlisted in World War 2, giving his age as 39 (instead of 54). On 15 February 1942 in Singapore, which was about to be surrendered to the Japanese, he was last seen picking up some grenades and walking towards the enemy saying: ‘No surrender for me.’ His body was never recovered.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">15 February 1942 (?)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">His name is commemorated on the Singapore Memorial.

The advance commenced in drizzling rain and was opposed by heavy fire. The first line of enemy trenches was taken but the advance was held up by a nest of machine gunners. Buckley with another man rushed the post, shooting four men and taking twenty-two prisoners. The Germans retreated to Peronne, entering the city by the main bridge which they then destroyed. The only remaining bridge on the battalion's front was a footbridge defended by machine guns. With three other members of his company, Buckley tried to force his way across under heavy fire.

      "title": "ANZAC Biscuits",
      "content": "The acronym ANZAC was coined in 1915 when Australian and New Zealand troops were training in Egypt. The word ANZAC was eventually applied to all Australian and New Zealand soldiers in World War 1. The term is particularly associated with the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.\n\nANZAC Day was inaugurated on 25 April 1916 to commemorate the first anniversary of the landing of the ANZAC troops at Gallipoli.\n\nDuring World War 1 and World War 2, Australians were fiercely patriotic. This can best be described in the words, my country - right or wrong. The wives, mothers and girlfriends were concerned for the nutritional value of the food being supplied to their men. Here was a problem. Any food they sent to the fighting men had to be carried in the ships of the Merchant Navy. Most of these were lucky to maintain a speed of ten knots (18.5 kilometres per hour). Most had no refrigerated facilities, so any food sent had to be able to remain edible after periods in excess of two months. A body of women came up with the answer - a biscuit with all the nutritional values possible. The basis was a Scottish recipe using rolled oats which were used extensively in Scotland, especially for a heavy porridge that helped counteract the extremely cold climate.\n\nThe ingredients they used were rolled oats, sugar, plain flour, coconut, butter, golden syrup or treacle, bi-carbonate of soda and boiling water. All these items did not readily spoil. At first the biscuits were called Soldiers' Biscuits, but after the landing on Gallipoli, they were renamed ANZAC Biscuits.\n\nA point of interest is the lack of eggs to bind the ANZAC biscuit mixture together. Because of the war, many of the poultry farmers had joined the services, thus eggs were scarce. The binding agent for the biscuits was golden syrup or treacle. Eggs that were sent long distances were coated with a product called ke peg (like Vaseline) then packed in air tight containers filled with sand to cushion the eggs and keep out the air.\n\nAs the war drew on, many groups like the CWA (Country Women's Association), church committees, schools and other women's organisations devoted a great deal of time to the making of ANZAC biscuits. To ensure that the biscuits remained crisp, they were packed in used tins such as Billy Tea tins. You can see some of these tins appearing in your supermarket as exact replicas of the ones of earlier years. Look around. The tins were airtight, thus no moisture in the atmosphere was able to soak into the biscuits and make them soft.\n\nDuring World War 2, with refrigeration in so many merchant navy ships, the biscuits were not made to any great extent as it was now possible to send a greater variety of food such as fruit cake.\n\nANZAC biscuits are still made today. They can also be purchased from supermarkets and specialty biscuit shops. Around ANZAC Day, these biscuits are also often used by veterans' organisations to raise funds for the care and welfare of aged war veterans.\n\nCompiled from information supplied by the CWA, Brisbane, the War Widows Guild, Brisbane and Queensland State Headquarters of the RSL\n\n**A Favourite Recipe**\n\n1 cup rolled oats\n\n1 cup plain flour \n\n1 cup sugar\n\n3/4 (three-quarters) cup coconut\n\n125g (4 oz) butter\n\n2 tablespoons golden syrup\n\n½ (half) teaspoon bicarbonate of soda\n\n1 tablespoon boiling water\n\nCombine oats, sifted flour, sugar and coconut.\n\nCombine butter and golden syrup, stir over gentle heat until melted.\n\nMix soda with boiling water, add to melted butter mixture, stir into dry ingredients.\n\nTake teaspoonfuls of mixture and place on lightly greased oven trays; allow room for spreading.\n\nCook in slow oven (150°C or 300°F) for 20 minutes.\n\nLoosen while still warm, then cool on trays.\n\nMakes about 35.\n\n\n",

The Turks advanced up a sap and blew in a sandbag barricade which Burton, Tubb (also a VC winner) and Dunstan (also a VC winner) quickly re-erected after they had repulsed the attackers. The enemy attacked twice more and destroyed the barricade. This was rebuilt when the enemy were driven off.

      "content": "Private Richard Warne MM 31st Battalion AIF \n\n\"Within Sight of Home\"\n\n**Acknowledgement**: This is one of a selection of stories written by Darryl Kelly about soldiers who served in WW1. It is intended that the stories soon be published as a book, “Just Soldiers\".\n\nSoldiers accept the risk of battle. The death, pain of wounds and the hidden fear of illness are commonplace. But fate can be a cruel and vicious player in the game and can deal you the worst of hands. This is one such story.\n\nRichard Warne was born to simple country folk in Maryborough, Queensland in 1898. A boy of the land, he worked hard on the family farm at Owanyilla to help meet his family's needs. He was bright at school and did well, but with not a lot of time on his hands, sport took second place. When a chance did arise, he relished a hard game of tennis.\n\nOn enlistment in the AIF in March of 1916, he was in a select group of recruits commonly known as \"The Fair Dinkums\". They were the recruits who knew what to expect after the carnage of Gallipoli, after the romanticism of the war had died with so many seeking the great adventure. Richard Warne was first posted to the ranks of the 41st Battalion. He relished his life in the military and adapted well to the rigours of training.\n\nIn May 1916 he boarded the troopship Demosthenes in Sydney. The ship was bound for England, for it was here that the diggers would hone their skills for the upcoming battles. In September 1916, Warne received his orders to embark for France.\nIt was at this point he found he was needed to help fill the ranks of the depleted 31st Battalion, which was engaged in heavy fighting at Flers.\n\nAs the young diggers moved up towards the line that first night, nothing in training could have prepared him for the sights, sounds and conditions he was about to experience. France was entering the worst winter in 100 years. Freezing cold, constant damp, knee deep mud and the constant presence of death were daily norms. The 31st Battalion, like all the units of the AIF, endured and held the enemy in these impossible conditions in this place called the Somme.\n\nIn February 1917, Warne was on a ration-carrying party supplying the front line. As the party weaved its way forward, the scream of artillery shells pierced the night. Diving to the ground, Warne and his carrying partner sought the safety of the mud. As the shells exploded, a red-hot splinter shattered the urn of boiling water they were carrying and drenched Warne's feet with its contents.\n\nAs the young soldier was carried to the dressing station, he pleaded not to have to leave his mates. The medics decided that the injury required specialist treatment in England and on the 8th of February 1917, Warne entered the Norfolk War Hospital. His stay was to last eight weeks.\n\nOn release from the hospital, Warne remained in England to assist in the training of recruits. When he read of the casualties and the loss of so many mates, he pestered his superiors to let him return to his battalion and the front so as to do his bit.\n\nIn October of 1917 he got his wish and re-embarked for France.\nIn November of that year Richard Warne had his first brush with the disciplinary side of the Army. He was charged with the serious crime of stealing. It wasn't money nor was it a mate's possessions, it was four pounds of apples (less than two kilos) which he had given to members of his section. He was found guilty and sentenced to one day's detention.\n\nThe 31st was again on the move through the carnage of the trenches. The shot, the shell, the death and destruction. The Aussies held their ground through the great German advance of April 1918.\n\nFinally the tide turned and they had Fritz on the run. It was now August 1918 and finally the Aussie Divisions were fighting side by side. The German General Ludendorff called it the \"Black Day\" of the German Army. At one point the 31st became bogged down and were driven back by accurate German artillery fire. The front was strewn with Australian wounded. Warne and a mate, Private Richard Stutz, also from Owanyilla, went out under heavy fire and dragged in their wounded mates. Both soldiers were awarded the Military Medal for their actions of that day. It is ironic, but after the war, Stutz would marry Warne's sister.\n\nBy now the Germans were retreating on all fronts with the Aussies hard on their heels. During an attack in September the 31st again came under heavy and accurate German artillery fire. A Lewis gun section which included Richard Warne sortied forward. They located the troublesome battery and engaged it with accurate small arms fire, serious enough to have the Germans temporarily abandon their guns. This respite allowed the 31st to move forward and continue the advance. Warne's name was submitted for a bar to his Military Medal, but it was not approved.\n\nAn armistice was declared on the 11th of November 1918. The battlefield adopted a strange, ghost-like silence. Finally the war was over. Private Richard Warne MM would have to wait his turn for a draft to go home. Those who had longer periods of service would be given first priority. He was sent to England on leave and took in the sights, sounds and celebrations of the allied victory.\n\nFinally the order came which he had waited three and a half years for. As the troopship neared the coast of Australia, diggers could swear they could smell the gum trees. Private Warne presented himself for a final medical board in Brisbane on the 22nd of August 1919. He was passed fit with no disabilities. He sent a telegram to his family stating that he would catch the first available train from Brisbane which was due in Owanyilla on the afternoon of the 25th.\n\nHe arranged to travel with Private George Black, also of the 31st. They had been the best of mates for the past 18 months and had looked out for each other, both in and out of the line. By a stroke of luck Warne was released on leave early and thought he would surprise his family by catching an earlier train which would arrive on the morning of the 25th of August.\n\nDuring the journey Warne learned the unbelievable - the train did not stop at Owanyilla. He asked if the driver would make a special allowance and make an unscheduled stop. The driver refused saying the best he could do was slow down to allow Warne to jump.\n\nAs the train slowed on its approach to Owanyilla around 5am, Warne glanced from the carriage. He could see the lights of his home and could imagine his mother cooking breakfast. Black walked with Warne to the carriage door, here they paused, shook hands and said their good-byes. As the platform came into view, Warne threw his kitbag from the train. It landed safely on the platform. He judged his time and jumped. Fate now took over. He found that the train was going too fast and he had missed the platform altogether. He bounced along the ground and hit a large rock with such force that it threw him under the wheels of the train. The wheels shattered the lower portion of his right leg. He was gashed about the head, had a compound fracture of the skull, and severe gravel rash over most of his body.\n\nAt about 7am, Mrs Eva Lay, the wife of a local linesman, made her way to the platform. Her job was to open the gates. She noticed the kitbag lying on the platform. Looking about she noticed the station was empty. Curiosity got the better of her and she made her way down the track. It was here she found the bloodied body of a young soldier. As she looked closer, she could see a slight rise and fall of his chest. It was the impossible. He was alive.\n\nBeing new to the area and with her husband away, she raced to the nearest farm for help. The farm was that of the Warne family. On arrival at the scene Richard and Clara Warne looked down at the battered form of the young soldier only to see that it was their own son, Richard.\n\nA series of telephone calls rattled along the ancient lines for the ambulance from Maryborough to be sent. On arrival the ambulance men did all they could. They placed young Richard in the back of the ambulance with his mother cradling her son's battered head. The ambulance sped towards Maryborough. As it approached the hospital, Private Richard Warne MM lost his final battle and died in his mother's arms.\n\nThe citizens of the Maryborough district contributed funds to have a memorial erected over the young soldier's grave. His mother never got over the death of her first born and secretly favourite child. She endured a further 41 years of the unbearable torture of his loss before she was finally laid to rest alongside him in 1960.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541570128/g8fcifkaaaozlpmsajhc.png)\n\nThe memorial.

Later, in the afternoon, the 53rd encountered intense fire from a strong point. Currey crept around the flank of the position and opened fire with a Lewis gun before rushing the post, inflicting many casualties and dispersing the survivors. His courageous action enabled the battalion attack to proceed. At 3 am next morning he volunteered to warn an isolated company to withdraw. Moving out into No Man’s Land he stood up and called out to the company. This brought a hail of enemy fire down upon him. His respirator was punctured and he was gassed, but he succeeded in contacting the exposed company which then returned safely.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">30 April 1948</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Plaque at Woronora Cemetery, Sydney.

Survivors were forced to shelter in a ditch under almost point-blank fire from a German machine gun. Davey then single-handedly attacked the enemy gun with grenades, putting half the crew out of action. Running out of grenades, he returned to his own position for more. In his next attack he killed the remainder of the crew, which had been reinforced and numbered eight, and captured the gun. He then mounted the captured gun in a new position and, until he was wounded, efficiently used it to repel a determined counter-attack.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">21 December 1953</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">AIF Cemetery, West Terrace, Adelaide</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Current location of the VC</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Australian War Memorial</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Heavy fire from Germans covering a gap in the wire pinned down the Australians. Gaby found a gap in the wire and, single-handedly, approached an enemy strong point while machine gun and rifle fire poured from it. He ran along the parapet, emptied his revolver into the garrison, drove the crews from their machine guns and forced fifty of the enemy to surrender. This resulted in the capture of four machine guns. He then reorganised his company and consolidated the objective.

He then crossed the objective with a small party and covered the advance of the rest of his company. Advancing ahead of the main party, he located, assaulted and captured many small parties of men and machine guns. At one stage he was able to report that the recently destroyed bridge over the Peronne moat was unguarded and his unit was able to cross nearby on planks and debris. Next day the 54th continued to clear Peronne of enemy. During a heavy barrage Hall carried a wounded comrade, who was urgently in need of medical attention, to safety.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">25 February 1978</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">St Matthew’s Anglican Church, West Bogan, New South Wales</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Current location of the VC</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Australian War Memorial</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

      "content": "**The Beersheba Charger**\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\n*In the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.*\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571106/l34dfj02hy4tygp7hovz.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

New recruits to the AIF\npause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571148/avuthlx6xofj4h9rkoox.png)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571171/kywytacfbrqndz7wce8j.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571211/bpy2x3ny03rm3op5ybfa.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Depicts the men and horses of the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade encountering Turkish trenches and defending Turkish soldiers. A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571293/pvfehdqfjkn8eh3fppxq.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571317/uasidic3mmeuc3bxfdvm.png)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres.

It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571432/pgcniihcrosc2gvkcd7j.png)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

Arthur Burgess, Emden beached and done for, 9 November 1914, 1920, Painting: oil on canvas, 168.5 x254.5 cm. The German light cruiser SMS Emden, aground and on fire after battle with the RAN light cruiser HMAS Sydney off Cocos-Keeling Islands, HMAS Sydney is visible in the far distance.**\n\nThe ships and men of the Royal Australian Navy operated as an integral part of the Royal Navy and served in all operational areas.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy’s first task was to protect Australia’s ports, shipping and trade routes. As part of securing Australia’s maritime frontiers, the RAN took part in the first amphibious assault of the war when it played a major role in the capture of the German New Guinea colony in the Pacific. On 14 September, a day after the official German surrender of the colony, the AE1, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant and accompanied by HMAS Parramatta, left Blanche Bay, New Britain, to patrol off Cape Gazelle. She was last seen by Parramatta at 3.30 pm that day and no trace has been found of her, or her company, since. The fate of the AE1 was never established, but it is probable that the submarine was caught on a coral reef and sank with the loss of all on board.\n\nAfter this operation, the ships of the RAN began the vital role of convoy escort. On 9 November 1914, whilst escorting a convoy near the Cocos Islands, the light cruiser HMAS Sydney was detached to investigate the sighting of a strange warship. This ship turned out to be the German light cruiser Emden. In the ensuing battle, Sydney destroyed the Emden and thus won the RAN’s first battle. The Sydney then served in the North Sea until the end of WW1, becoming the first ship to catapult a seaplane — on 8 December 1917.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571783/ozzvdrambvojwotp3pxe.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Ten minutes earlier, the cease fire had been given in her battle with the German cruiser Emden, which had run ashore onto a reef on North Direction Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Sydney then pursued the collier Buresk—appropriated by the Germans—at full speed, and sent armed men aboard her. However, the German crew took steps to ensure that the collier sank. The crew were taken off. **\n\nThe Navy also played a supporting role in the Gallipoli campaign when HMAS AE2 became the first allied warship to penetrate the Dardanelles — an operation which made the AE2 famous. The submarine, commanded by Lieutenant Commander H. S. Stoker, was ordered to sail through the Dardanelles and disrupt Turkish shipping in the Sea of Marmara. No other submarine had yet managed to breach the Turkish defences, but in the early hours of 25 April 1915, the AE2 got past minefields and land-based guns, and after torpedoing a Turkish destroyer, it reached the Sea of Marmora. The AE2 remained at large for five more days before sustaining irreparable damage while under heavy fire. Stoker was forced to sink the submarine and surrender. All the crew survived and were taken prisoner, and together with Stoker, spent the next three and a half years as ‘guests’ of the Turks. Stoker escaped twice but was recaptured. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order after the war.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571818/zuzfmlgcaejfhvzfzgnv.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Charles Bryant, HMAS Sydney’s *fight with a Zeppelin in the North Sea,* c. 1931, Painting: oil on canvas, 102 x 127.4 cm. ‘HMAS Sydney’s fight with a Zeppelin in the North Sea‘ portrays an unusual action involving the Australian light cruiser *Sydney* which took place on 4 May 1917. Under Captain John Dumaresq the cruiser was leading a British ship, *Dublin*, and four destroyers on a sweep of channels south east of Rosyth, Scotland, between the Forth and Humber estuaries, when the force came under attack from the German naval Zeppelin L43. The five-engined airship was first sighted shortly before 10.30am, approaching the east at about the same time as Dumaresq discovered that several submarines were in his vicinity. By charging in the dirigible’s direction and opening fire with anti-aircraft guns at extreme range, the cruisers forced the airship to rise steeply and veer off. As soon as Dumaresq ordered his force to resume its original course, the L43 began stalking the ships. After failing to gain a bomb dropping position on the Dublin, the Zeppelin targeted one of the destroyers and managed to land three bombs within ten metres of it. The airship captain then turned his attention to Sydney which began evasive action. The duel continued for two hours, drawing to an inconclusive end only after the Zeppelin ran out of bombs at about 2.30pm. By then the cruisers had also expended all ammunition for their high altitude guns. Both sides reportedly parted on good terms. *Sydney* had become the first Royal Australian Navy vessel to be subjected to an air attack.**\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571880/lbyam74rrqojw5fjrlnd.png)\n\n**The daunting task facing the AE2, of travelling through to the Sea of Marmara, is reflected in this map of the Dardanelles Strait (left).

The 1st Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train was sent to Gallipoli to prepare for the British landings at Suvla Bay in August 1915. The unit performed well under relentless shrapnel fire and remained at Suvla until the end of the campaign.\n\nHaving constructed the piers used during the British landing, the bridging train carried out maintenance duties; assisted with the landing of troops, stores, and ammunition; and finally assisted with the evacuation in December.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541571919/tq8pdqg4pnkbc3b6adjp.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The crew were taken back to Germany for internment as prisoners of war.**\n\n**The Merchant Navy in WW1**\n\nWe should not overlook the contribution of the merchant seamen during the Great War.\n\nIn wartime, nations with extensive global interests involved in such confrontations look towards their merchant ships for sea lift capabilities in the transportation of their military personnel, equipment and supplies to wherever—and whenever—they are required; to sustain them for the duration with the necessary arms and ammunition, fuel and food and all the paraphernalia of war; and then bring everyone safely back home again.\n\nWe in Australia and New Zealand commemorate 25 April as ANZAC Day, setting aside the day to remember and to pay homage to our fallen comrades. This day was born out of the Gallipoli campaign, but how many people are aware of the involvement of the Merchant Navy in that campaign.\n\nThe merchant ships took all of our troops to Gallipoli, and in many cases landed our troops on the beach at ANZAC Cove in the ships’ lifeboats — manned by merchant seamen, who also came under the deadly fire from the Turkish guns.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the great majority of wounded in that campaign were taken in the ships’ lifeboats — with merchant seamen manning the oars — to the hospital ships which were waiting offshore. The merchant ships evacuated most of our troops from Gallipoli to Alexandria, Lemnos and Cyprus and then transported the wounded home to Australia.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572035/hi1z3lbf0fk3cqxj8wui.png)\n\nIn the foreground, French troops training on Lemnos Island prior to the Gallipoli landing.

Engineers with the party blew up two bomb stores and five minutes later the party withdrew after causing considerable havoc, but as they crossed no man’s land they suffered casualties from enemy artillery fire. Jackson got back to his lines safely, handed over a prisoner, and immediately went back out into the heavy shell fire to assist in bringing in one of the thirteen wounded. He went out again and was assisting a sergeant to bring in another wounded man when his arm was blown off and the sergeant was knocked unconscious. Despite his terrible wounds Jackson returned to his lines and got assistance, then went out again to search for the sergeant and the wounded man he had been helping in. One of the men was located and escorted to safety and Jackson was then dispatched for treatment. His arm was amputated.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">5 August 1959</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Plaque at Springvale Crematorium, Melbourne.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Current location of the VC</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Privately held</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>More information</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\"><a href=\"https://www.chapter-one.com/vc/award.asp?vc=628\" target=\"_blank\">www.chapter-one.com/vc/award.asp?vc=628</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

From this modest beginning Australia became the only British dominion to set up a flying corps of its own for service during the First World War.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572238/ywa5k6ve6qiacuy8q5py.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Will Longstaff, War planes of the Australian Flying Corps, 1918-1919,\nPainting: oil on canvas, 236 x 141 cm.**\n\nKnown as the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and organised as a corps of the Australian Imperial Force, its four line squadrons usually served separately under the orders of Britain’s Royal Flying Corps. The AFC’s first complete flying unit, No.1 Squadron, left Australia for the Middle East in March 1916. By late 1917 three more squadrons, Nos.2, 3, and 4 had been formed to fight in France. A further four training squadrons based in England formed an Australian Training Wing to provide pilots for the Western Front.\n\nBefore No.1 squadron made its journey to the Middle East, Australian airmen had been in action in Mesopotamia. A Turkish threat to the Anglo-Persian oil pipeline and the strategically important area at the head of the Persian Gulf (the Shatt-el-Arab) convinced British strategists of the need to open a second front against the Turks. The Australian Government was asked to provide aircraft, airmen and transport to support the Anglo-Indian forces assigned to the campaign. It responded by dispatching four officers, 41 men, and transport—called the Mesopotamian Half Flight—in April 1915. Arriving too late to help secure the Shatt-el-Arab and the oil pipeline, the Half Flight joined the British advance on Baghdad, an operation intended to exert additional pressure on the Turks in the east.\n\nThe attempt to reach Baghdad failed, and some 13000 British and Indian troops found themselves besieged by superior Turkish forces in the city of Kut, about 80 miles south of their objective. Attempts to relieve the siege failed, and in April 1916 the garrison at Kut, including members of the Half Flight, surrendered. Taken prisoner by the Turks, few survived captivity. The defeat on the Tigris marked the end of Australia’s first experience of military aviation. The Mesopotamian Half Flight and No.1 Squadron were both formed early in the war, when military aviation was in its experimental stages, and both contained some of Australia’s aviation pioneers.\n\nThroughout 1916 and much of 1917 No.1 Squadron flew inferior aircraft such as the BE2c against German opponents who, supporting the Turkish armies in the Middle East, were equipped with more advanced Fokkers and Aviatiks. However, by the end of 1917, newly equipped with Bristol Fighters, the Allied airmen began to gain the ascendancy.\n\nArriving in England between December 1916 and March 1917 and doing eight months training before being sent to the Front, 2, 3 and 4 Squadrons began their active service at a time when the use of aircraft in war was far more developed.\n\nIt was different for members of the AFC who served in the Western Front squadrons. The days when enemy airmen waved to each other on reconnaissance flights were long gone. Aircraft now carried machine guns as standard equipment, and interrupter gears, developed in 1915, enabled pilots in single-seat fighters to fire straight ahead through their propellers.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572290/z8hhysttd9tk6c5pg7tr.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Treloar was one of the officers of the Mesopotamian Half Flight..**\n\nBy 1918 aircraft were being used in a variety of roles: some as fighters, others for reconnaissance or artillery spotting and others for bombing operations inside enemy territory.\n\nThe AFC’s best aircraft in the final year of the war were among the most technically advanced of the day. Bristol’s BF2b, a two-seat fighter-bomber known as the Bristol Fighter, could climb to 10000 feet in 11 minutes and fly at 113 miles an hour when it got there. The famous Sopwith Camel could reach 12000 feet in 12 minutes, fully loaded with weapons and ammunition, and fly as quickly as the Bristol Fighter. Pilots and observers sat exposed to the elements in noisy open cockpits.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572326/fcs343iykt5ufzygtciv.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Note the tail of the aircraft is supported so the aircraft can be in a level position for testing machine guns on the range prior to an offensive patrol.**\n\nGiven the nature of warfare on the Western Front, it is not difficult to imagine why men would seek to transfer into the AFC. Many had experienced the misery and squalor of the trenches. Those who knew they would face danger as long as they were in the AIF preferred to face it in a corps which offered the promise of independence and glamour, as well as a degree of comfort unknown to the men in the trenches. Those who served in the Middle East, although spared the worst miseries of the Western Front, shared a similar desire to escape their own discomforts: the sand, the dust and the flies. Men who had already served in the ground forces reasoned that if they survived the day’s flying they would at least have the chance to sleep in a comfortable bed.\n\nNot everyone, however, survived the day’s flying. Many pilots were killed in accidents long before they could join a line squadron. Over a third of the AFC’s wartime fatalities occurred in Britain. Some trainees died even after the war had ended: as one pilot wrote in March 1919:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">A great pal of mine was on his very last flight — his last test before qualifying … a mist arose, he flew into the ground and was killed. He had enlisted in 1914, gone through much front-line service, only to be killed on his absolute final exploit, four months after the armistice.</p>\n\nPilots who survived training were posted to operational squadrons where the thought of meeting the enemy in the sky was enough to give even the bravest men pause for thought. Harry Cobby, who went on to become the AFC’s leading ace, admitted his own fear at the thought of being posted to the front:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The nervousness that assailed me during the months of training in England, when I gave thought to the fact that as soon as I was qualified to fly an aeroplane, or perhaps sooner, I would be sent off to the war to do battle with the enemy in the sky and on the ground. I quite freely admit that if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour, I would have left nothing undone to bring it about.</p>\n\nCobby overcame his early fears to become a highly successful pilot. Others were less skilled or less fortunate. Owen Lewis, an observer in No.3 Squadron, was an experienced airman. An entry in his diary on a day when bad weather prevented flying reveals his feelings about operations: ‘This morning I was pleased when the weather was fairly dud -- I am afraid I am always pleased when that is so.’ His fears were justified. On 12 April 1918, the day after he had teamed up with a new pilot, both men were killed in action.\n\nTwo main types of aircraft were used by the AFC: two-seater reconnaissance planes, in which the observer, armed with machine guns, sat behind the pilot; and single-seater fighters. The latter dominated the popular imagination: they were the aces, flying the fastest aircraft and fighting duels with men like themselves above the trenches. In reality, aerial combat was a difficult skill to master, requiring split-second timing and complete mastery of one’s aircraft and weapons. A man in No.1 Squadron described a dog-fight as:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Every man for himself. We go hell-for-leather at those snub-nosed, black crossed busses of the Hun, and they at us ... Hectic work. Half-rolling, diving, zooming, stalling, ‘split-slipping’, by inches you miss collision with friend or foe. Cool precise marksmanship is out of the question.</p>\n\nHe was in fact the observer in a two-seater and thus did not have the opportunity to use a forward firing machine-gun. Those like Cobby who flew in fighters also found that in a dogfight, which by the end of the war, could involve up to 100 aircraft, hitting the enemy was very difficult:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The air was too crowded, there was little opportunity to settle down and have a steady shot at anything. You would no sooner pick out someone to have a crack at, than there would be the old familiar ‘pop-pop-pop-pop’ behind you, or you would just glimpse an enemy pilot getting into position to fire on yourself — so hard boot and stick one way to save your skin.</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572527/jpausbnpua870yp1qyyn.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

An Avro DH 5 fighter aircraft, found by the Australian Flying Corps to be a very good machine.**\n\nMost of Cobby’s kills appear to have been scored against unsuspecting victims over whom he had the advantage of surprise and speed.\n\nWhen two skilled opponents met in the air, the fight was often lengthy: both men knew that only one would survive. The German airman, Ernst Udet, described one such combat: ‘I tried every trick I knew, turns, loops, rolls and sideslips — but he followed each movement with lightning speed and gradually I began to realise that he was more than a match for me … the man was a superior duellist.’ When his guns jammed, Udet thought he was doomed; but he was lucky—his antagonist turned his aircraft upside down, waved farewell and dived towards the Allied line.\n\nAs Udet discovered, the air war could sometimes be chivalrous. As the Australian historian, F.M. Cutlack, wrote ‘the star airmen of the opposing armies regarded each other with a curious mixture of personal esteem and deadly hostility.’ Many toasts were drunk to Richthofen by men who would have gladly killed him given the chance. When he was killed, Australian airmen placed wreaths on his grave. In the Middle East Oberleutnant Gerhardt Felmy, the leading German pilot facing No.1 Squadron, earned the admiration of his adversaries. It was not uncommon for him to drop messages from and photographs of recently captured Australian airmen on their home field. The Australians did the same for the Germans and drank toasts to Felmy in their mess. On the Western Front captured enemy pilots were treated with respect by their Allied counterparts and vice-versa. In practice there was not much room for chivalry. In 1918 Australian pilots on the Western Front flew regular operations against enemy forces on the ground. ‘The job’, wrote Cobby,\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">‘consisted of getting to the ‘line’ … as fast and often as one could, and letting the enemy on the ground have it as hot and heavy as possible. … All this flying was done under 500 feet and our targets were point blank ones … The air was full of aircraft, and continuously while shooting-up the troops on the ground we would be attacked by enemy scouts … The smoke of the battle below mixed with the clouds and mist above rendered flying particularly dangerous. … On top of this there were scores of machine-guns devoting their time to making things as unpleasant for us as they could.’</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572611/xqzzgrsqtskzw2siz21k.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying on a bombing operation, saw a fellow squadron member, Captain D. W. Rutherford, shot down. Although having just suffered a serious leg wound, McNamara landed near the stricken Rutherford who climbed aboard, but his wound prevented McNamara from taking off and his aircraft crashed. The two men made it back to Rutherford’s plane which they succeeded in starting and, with McNamara at the controls, they took off just as enemy cavalry reached the scene.**\n\nSuch flights were both dangerous and exhausting. ‘I always emerged from them almost rigid with tension,’ commented Cobby. Nevertheless, they must have given pilots and observers the feel of an even contest. In September 1918, with the Turkish armies in full retreat, No.1 Squadron had a very different experience of attacking men on the ground.\n\nOn the morning of 21 September, British and Australian bombers discovered the main Turkish column passing through a gorge on the Wady Fara road. Having bombed the lead vehicles, trapping those behind on the narrow road, the airmen proceeded to destroy as many of the Turks as they could. Clive Conrick, an observer in No.1 Squadron, described the slaughter as he turned his machine guns on the trapped men below, many of whom sought to escape by climbing the cliffs above the road. Flying almost parallel to the fleeing men Conrick was close enough to see,\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">'chips of rock fly off the cliff face and red splotches suddenly appear on the Turks who would stop climbing and fall and their bodies were strewn along the base of the cliff like a lot of dirty rags. When Nunan [his pilot] was climbing again to renew his attack, I had a better opportunity to machine gun the troops and transports on the road.'</p>\n\nAs the attacks continued throughout the day, the Turkish survivors waved white flags. ‘But,’ wrote Conrick, ‘it was quite impossible for us to accept the surrender of the enemy, so we just kept on destroying them.’ Another No.1 Squadron observer, L. W. Sutherland, called it ‘sheer butchery’.\n\nAt the same time Sutherland recognised that he was witnessing a significant moment in the wartime use of aircraft. ‘A vitally important duty had been given to us,’ he wrote. ‘For the war, we, the newest arm of the service, had the most onerous work in a major operation. We were not going to fall down on our job. But oh, those killings! ... Only the lucky ones slept that night.’ Such one-sided encounters were relatively rare. Experiences like those of Cobby on the Western Front were more typical.\n\nIn an age when few had flown, many men found that flying could be fun. Donald Day, formerly of the Australian Army Medical Corps, became a pilot in May 1918. He transferred to the AFC too late to fly on operations and remained in England until the armistice, but he appreciated the joy that flying could bring:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">One of the finest experiences of flying is to closely examine the large fleecy white clouds. They contain features similar to very rugged country gullies, hills etc. In places the gully turns sharply, too much so for a turn, and into cloud one goes; no cloud with sun shining, the shadow of the machines may be seen surrounded by a complete rainbow halo.</p>\n\nEven the more reserved Lewis was able to appreciate the beauty of flying. On a bumpy flight one morning in February 1918 his nausea gave way to delight as his pilot broke through the clouds. ‘It was extremely beautiful. On one occasion we flew round a balloon which was over Ypres and we both waved to the balloonatic who answered in a like manner.’\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541572696/aec216zjshwuowdm0ddo.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

These balloons made manned observation flights over enemy positions.**\n\nGiving young men control of what were then the most high-powered and sophisticated aircraft in production could also lead to mischief. Some pilots in No.1 Squadron devised a game called ‘feluccaring’ on account of its practice of flying around small boats — known as feluccas — in such a way as to make them capsize and sink, leaving the one-man crew to swim ashore. Such a thoughtless tactic, probably a game to the airmen, was unfortunately all too typical of the often racist attitudes of Australian troops to the people of the Middle East.\n\nDuring the last weeks of the fighting there, No.1 Squadron flew in support of the Allied advance into Palestine, moving from one airfield to another as their armies pursued the retreating Turks northwards. As armoured motor vehicles and cavalry raced to keep in touch with the fleeing Turks during October 1918, the only fighting that continued in the Middle East was in the air. The war against Turkey ended on 31 October 1918. No.1 Squadron returned to Egypt after the armistice and embarked for Australia in January 1919.\n\nThe war against Germany lasted only a few days longer. As the German Army on the Western Front retreated eastwards, their airmen continued to fight.\n\nOctober and early November 1918 were characterised by massive sweeps of Allied aircraft over the German lines. Combats were frequent as air battles continued and Allied airmen bombed and strafed the retreating Germans on the ground. Even on the last day of the war, No.2 Squadron was bombing the Germans while No.4 Squadron flew escort.\n\nAfter the armistice, No.4 Squadron became the only Australian unit of the British Army of Occupation, entering Germany on 7 December 1918. Each of the Australian squadrons that had served on the Western Front left Europe for home in early March 1919. During the war, 460 officers and 2234 men served in the AFC and 178 had been killed. By the standards of the First World War these casualties were light. The AFC was a pioneering corps, laying the groundwork for the Royal Australian Air Force and making a significant contribution to Australian civil aviation, through the efforts of men such as Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, MC, Sir W Hudson Fysh KBE, DFC, (the founder of QANTAS) and the brothers, Captain Sir Ross Smith KBE, MC, DFC, AFC., and Lieutenant Sir Keith Smith KBE.\n\nText and images reproduced with the kind permission of the Australian War Memorial.

He reformed the men and urged them forward but they were again halted by intense fire from Plateau Wood. Joynt, who was then joined by a platoon from his own battalion, decided to seize Plateau Wood. A German post and fifty prisoners were quickly taken. Joynt then led his men along a trench across the plateau, capturing prisoners as they went, to within fifty metres of the machine guns holding up the advance. At one stage twenty enemy advanced towards him with their rifles poised so Joynt covered their leader with a revolver and they surrendered. Finding another trench, Joynt was able to lead his men without casualties into the German position and so force them out of the wood. He returned to his battalion to find that his company commander had been wounded and that he was to assume command. From then until he was wounded in another attack three days later, he was always in the fight as the advance continued.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Died</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">5 May 1986</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Buried or Commemorated</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Brighton Cemetery, Melbourne</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-4 mb-2 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Current location of the VC</strong></div>\n<div class=\"col-8\">Privately held</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

      "content": "<h3>The WW1 Nurses</h3>\n\nby **Roslyn Bell**\n\nOne of the least publicized of all Army services is the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps, which has given more than 100 years of dedicated work to caring for Australian servicemen in times of war and its aftermath.\n\nThe history of the Corps dates back to 1898 when a small nursing service was formed in Sydney. It consisted of one Lady Superintendent and twenty-four nurses. The first actual service of nurses with Australian troops was during the Boer War (1898-1903).\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, the Australian Government raised the first Australian Imperial Force for overseas service. The nurses to staff the medical units, which formed an integral part of the AIF, were recruited from the Australian Army Nursing Service Reserve and from the civil nursing profession.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573238/cpbamcwsnhfuzgkrk688.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Many are wearing their life jackets over their long nurses uniforms. The Karoolawas initially used as a troop transport, but on arrival at Southampton, England, she was converted to a hospital ship, with accommodation for approximately 460 patients. As a hospital ship she made numerous voyages between England and Australia.**\n\nSenior officers were more inclined to have trained male soldiers in preference to female nurses. Major General Howse, Director of Medical Services, has been quoted as saying that ‘the female nurse — as a substitute for the fully trained male nursing orderly — did little toward the actual saving of life in war … although she might promote a more rapid and complete recovery’. General Howse was speaking at a time when the contribution of the Nursing Service to the treatment of the wounded soldiers, at an early stage, had yet to be recognized by the Australian authorities.\n\nThe first draft of Sisters left Australia in September 1914 and throughout the war, the Nursing Service served wherever Australian troops were sent. A number were also sent to British units in various theatres of war.\n\nAustralian nurses served in places such as Vladivostok, Burma, India, the Persian Gulf, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France and England. The record of service for these Sisters is outstanding, and one which set a very high standard for all who were to follow. The statistics are noteworthy:\n\n2139 served overseas\n\n423 served in Australia\n\n25 died\n\n388 were decorated\n\n(Seven Military Medals were awarded to Australian Nurses for their courage under fire.)\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573280/fa5ezfgvhrobk1gxn9s8.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Group portrait of AANS nursing sisters at 3rd Australian General Hospital (3AGH).**\n\nAn example of one nursing officer’s experience under fire is from her diary from a Casualty Clearing Station at the Western Front:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The noise was so terrific, and the concussion so great that I was thrown to the ground and had no idea where the damage was. I flew through the chest and abdo [abdomen] wards and called out: ‘are you alright boys?’<br>‘Don’t bother about us,’ was the general cry.</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573355/q0tvckhtgwfdds2cnsui.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Two members of the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) with patients in Victoria War Hospital, Bombay.**\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">All the hospitals’ lights were out and there was a faint moon, but the sky overhead was full of searchlights and fragments from the bursting anti-aircraft artillery. I passed the cook running for an adjacent paddock, swearing hard and complaining that the bombs had put his fire out.</p>\n\nRunning on, she suddenly fell headlong into a bomb crater …\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I shall never forget the awful climb on hands and feet out of that hole that was about five feet [1.5 metres] deep with greasy clay and blood (although I did not know then that it was blood).</p>\n\nShe raced back to the tent and was shortly joined by the badly shaken Padre, who went off to get help — after urging her to take cover. She ignored the advice and again tried to get into the tent. Grabbing hold of a handle under the fly, she tried to drag a stretcher free. The patient was dead, and the splintered handle came away in her hand, throwing her backwards into the crater again.\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I cannot remember what came next, or what I did, except that I kept calling for the orderly to help me and thought he was funking, but the poor boy had been blown to bits. Somebody got the tent up, and when I got to the delirious pneumonia patient, he was crouched on the ground at the back of the stretcher. He took no notice of me when I asked him to return to bed, so I leaned across the stretcher and put one arm around and tried to lift him in. I had my right arm under a leg, which I thought was his, but when I lifted I found to my horror that it was a loose leg with a boot and a puttee on it. It was one of the orderly’s legs which had been blown off and had landed on the patient’s bed. The next day they found the trunk [torso] about 20 yards [18 metres] away.</p>\n\nTo put into some perspective the workloads and consequent stresses these nurses endured, consider:\n\n- During the First World War, a one thousand-bed hospital in Cairo — completely under tentage, without any floor covering — was staffed by one matron, 15 Sisters and 30 staff nurses.\n- In 1917, in France, one of the hospitals had to be extended to 2000 beds during a ‘heavy rush’.\n\nActing under such adverse conditions, these women proved themselves to be of awesome dedication.\n\nSister Alice Ross-King, ARRC, MM\n\n**from Just Soldiers by Darryl Kelly**\n\nOne such lady who was truly worthy of the title ‘front-line angel’ was Alice Appleford (nee Ross-King).\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573481/rmxolujpkwnhtomlxrwe.png)\n\n**Sister Alice Ross-King ARRC, MM. (Photograph courtesy Mark Appleford)**\n\nAlys Ross was born in the Victorian town of Ballarat, in August 1891.1 She was of hardy Scottish stock and while she was still a toddler, her father had moved the family to Perth in search of a better life. Following a tragic fishing accident which claimed the lives of her husband and two sons, Mrs Ross returned to Melbourne with her daughter.2\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573509/gqgxbe4mypazjtdw3fpf.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Wounded from Gallipoli being transferred from hospital ship Gascon to trains for transfer to hospital in Cairo.**\n\nAlys attended some of the finer Melbourne schools for young ladies and from an early age decided on a career in nursing. She started her training at the Alfred Hospital and remained there until she completed her Certificate in Nursing. As Sister Alys Ross she continued at the hospital, where she added to her qualification, that of a theatre sister, and at times was called upon to fill the position of acting matron.1\n\nWith the onset of war, Sister Ross enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in November 1914. 3\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573569/gz1v0j8htgqs0hygdfel.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Medical supplies waiting to be loaded aboard hospital ship Kyarra, 1914.**\n\nDuring her AIF service she used the surname Ross-King and changed the spelling of her Christian name to Alice. Her mother was extremely upset with her daughter’s decision to go to war. Alice was all the family she had left and the thought that her only child might be killed or injured weighed heavily on Mrs Ross’s mind.\n\nAlice was allocated to the 1st Australian General Hospital (AGH) and sailed for Egypt on 21 November 1914 aboard the hospital ship Kyarra.4 The 1st Australian General Hospital was based in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis and the nursing staff was kept busy with a constant stream of patients emanating from the AIF desert training camps at Mena.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573600/lzhxz3gkjvspxf8s1lam.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Courtyard of hospital seen from balcony of a ward. Convalescent patients under trees and on stairs; nurse on stairs. 14AGH was housed in an Army barracks.**\n\nIt wasn’t all work in those early days in Egypt, and the nurses enjoyed an active social life. They hosted afternoon teas on the lawns of their quarters and they were always the first to be invited to the dances at the various officers’ messes dotted around Cairo.\n\nWith the imminent departure of the 1st Division to Gallipoli, it was decided to prepare other hospital facilities in anticipation for the expected tide of wounded soldiers. Alice, along with a number of other nurses, was detached to the nearby city of Suez, where they were tasked to prepare suitable buildings to be used as clearing stations for Gallipoli casualties.5\n\nTheir worst fears were realised when, in late April 1915, the first of the wounded from the Gallipoli beachhead reached the wards. Alice and the other dedicated nursing staff worked around the clock, tending to their patients and fighting overwhelming odds to improve the survival prospects of many of the most seriously wounded. Sometimes they were successful. Other times they had to face the heartbreaking reality that their best efforts had failed. To those in their care they were truly front-line angels.\n\nIt was decided that some of the more gravely wounded would be returned to Australia — to make room for others of the increasing number of casualties. As the wounded would need nursing care during their voyage home, it was necessary for some of the nurses to accompany them to provide ongoing treatment during the trip. Sister Ross-King was amongst those chosen to return to Australia.1\n\nAlice was aware that a shortage of nursing staff at home might jeopardise her chances of returning to the front. Immediately after she landed in Australia, she sought to secure orders to be sent back to Egypt. She enjoyed a short leave with her mother before again bidding her a tearful good-bye.\n\nIn April 1916, Sister Ross-King helped establish 1AGH in France.5 The hospital was based in Rouen and the medical staff quickly prepared themselves for the onslaught of casualties from the ‘real’ war. They didn’t have to wait long — actions at Fromelles in the north and Pozieres on the Somme kept the hard-pressed nurses working around the clock.\n\nRoss-King remained at 1AGH Rouen for the duration of the Somme offensive then joined the 10th Stationary Hospital at St Omer in the north of France. In July 1917, Alice was moved forward to the 2nd Australian Casualty Clearing Station which was situated close to the battlefront near Trois Arbres.5\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573630/no9skjaqulzbzwtas7l1.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Most of the patients treated were wounded in the fighting of the Third Battle of Ypres.**\n\nOne night — only five days after her arrival — Alice was making her way back to her tent at the end of her shift. As she followed a young orderly along the duckboards, she heard the high-pitched sound of approaching aircraft. Staring skyward, she could see the grey outline of the planes and as they came closer she could distinguish the bold crosses on the wings.\n\nShe knew that the hospital was clearly marked with large red crosses but, despite this, the German pilots seemed hell-bent on attacking. She heard the whistle of falling bombs just before one of the missiles exploded directly in front of her, knocking her to the ground. Regaining her senses, Alice looked around for the orderly but could not see him. Realising the enormity of the situation, she rushed back to her patients.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573672/ij6bgd699ns9fsd6tm5d.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

St. Omer, France, 2nd Casualty Clearing Station tent lines, 12 kilometres from the town.**\n\nThe deadly projectiles were now bursting amid the buildings and tents. As she ran to the wards, she found what was left of the pneumonia ward tent. The extract in her diary reads:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">Though I shouted, nobody answered me or I could hear nothing for the roar of the planes and artillery. I seemed to be the only living thing about.</p>\n\nDuring the ensuing hours, Alice’s actions were inspirational. Little did she know that her work on that terrible night would result in her being awarded the Military Medal, ‘for great coolness and devotion to duty’.6\n\nBy now, the AIF was locked in the Third Battle of Ypres and the casualty clearing station was filled to capacity with wounded Diggers. The doctors and nurses worked tirelessly as the sheer volume of casualties and the severity of their wounds taxed the medical staff to their limits. Alice wrote:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">The Last Post is being played nearly all day at the cemetery next door to the hospital. So many deaths … 5</p>\n\nIn November 1917, Alice returned to Rouen where she was promoted to Head Sister, 1AGH. Accompanied by a number of other sisters and nurses, Alice moved to an advanced dressing station just behind the front lines. The stream of incoming wounded seemed endless and the days were long and tiring. After one such shift, when they had finally gained the upper hand, the doctor said, ‘That’s the lot for now, Sister. Why don’t you get some sleep while you can?’\n\nAs she made her way back to her tent, she heard the feeble, anguished moans of wounded men. She searched until she found the source—53 badly wounded German prisoners who had been all but forgotten for the past three days. ‘Doctor! Doctor! Come quickly!’ she called frantically.\n\nAlice’s diary entry summed up the situation that confronted her:\n\n<p class=\"p-4 font-italic\">I shall never forget the cries that greeted me. They had gone without food or water … everyone on our staff was dead beat but I got the doctor to come and fix them up. We did forty patients in 45 minutes (the other 13 had died). No waiting for chloroform … amputations and all, and onto the train an hour and a half after I had found them.</p>\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541573757/jsydfpg1lsbpt90sbfsl.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Major A R Appleford, ARRC, MM, Assistant Controller, Australian Army Medical Women’s Service.**\n\nAlice was twice Mentioned in Despatches and she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, 2nd Class, in the King’s Birthday Honours of 1918.6\n\nWith the cessation of hostilities following the Armistice, Alice returned to England. In January 1919 she boarded a troopship bound for home. It was during the voyage that she met her future husband, Dr Sydney Appleford. The pair married later that year and settled in rural Victoria.\n\nWith the onset of the Second World War, Alice Appleford took on the task of training members of the Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs) — medically trained but not fully qualified nurses who worked in convalescent hospitals, on hospital ships and in the blood bank, as well as on the home front.\n\nIn 1949, Alice was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for her considerable efforts in support of the Red Cross and Service charities.5\n\nAn extract of the citation sums up this amazing woman:\n\nNo-one who came in contact with Major Appleford could fail to recognise her as a leader of women. Her sense of duty, her sterling solidity of character, her humility, sincerity and kindliness of heart set for others a very high example.\n\nAlice Appleford died on 17 August 1968, but her memory lives on in the Alice Appleford Memorial Award, which is presented annually to an outstanding member of the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps.\n\n1.

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th and 14th served overseas; the others were based in Australia. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 14th were all eventually upgraded to the maximum size.\n\n**1st Australian General Hospital** (1AGH) Formed Queensland, August 1914. Departed Brisbane aboard Kyarra 21 November 1914. (Egypt, Western Front)\n\n**1AGH Egypt** This hospital was located in various buildings in Cairo. It dealt with all war cases—physical injuries, diseases, shell shock.\n\n**1AGH Rouen**, France This hospital dealt with general battle casualties.\n\n**2nd Australian General Hospital (2AGH)** Formed New South Wales August 1914. Departed Sydney aboard Kyarra 28 November 1914. (Egypt, Western Front)\n\n**2AGH Boulogne, France** This was a large tented hospital, and most of the patients were battle casualties. It came to specialise in the treatment of fractures. This hospital experienced many air raids. Towards the end of the war there were outbreaks of influenza. When the armistice was signed, the staff barely found time to celebrate. They were too busy treating the influenza victims who continued to arrive throughout November.\n\n**3rd Australian General Hospital (3AGH)** Formed New South Wales 1915. Departed Sydney aboard Mooltan 5 May 1915. (England, Gallipoli, Egypt, Western Front)\n\n**3AGH Abbeville, France** This hospital operated from tents and huts at Abbeville, in the Somme area of France. For most of its existence (May 1917 to May 1918) it admitted gassed patients and treated them briefly before sending them to other places.\n\n**10th General Hospital** Formed July 1915. Departed Australia 22 July 1915. Arrived in the United Kingdom 29 September 1915. This unit was intended as a 500 bed general hospital for the treatment of Australians in the United Kingdom, but owing to a lack of accommodation and poor AIF medical administration, it was broken up at Harefield, England in October 1915 and personnel used to staff Auxiliary Hospitals. (England)\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541575066/vt0r1gr2edmp4t4yqrz1.png)\n\nThe maps above and below depict the area where the AIF trained before going to Gallipoli.\nThe medical facilities were necessary to support the troops while in training and later,\nafter deployment to Gallipoli.\n\n**14th General Hospital** Formed 1916. Departed Melbourne 19 August 1916. Was located at Abbassia, Cairo. (Egypt)\n\nAuxiliary Hospitals\nThese were located in rear areas. Generally they were administered by a general hospital (AGH). They had no fixed establishments.\n\n**1st Australian Auxiliary Hospital (1AAH)** Opened 19 January 1915 at Luna Park, Cairo, Egypt. Closed 10 July 1916. Opened 1916 at Harefield, England. Closed 31 December 1918. This hospital contained over 1000 beds for casualties from France. Mostly they were surgical cases and it was possible for special attention to be given to amputees before their return to Australia.\n\n**2nd Australian Auxiliary Hospital (2AAH)** This hospital located at Southall, England, specialised in the fitting of artificial limbs.\n\n**3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital (3AAH)** This hospital, located in Dartford, England, grew to 1400 beds and was for the treatment of war-related nerves and neuroses.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541575108/nikjsvbnjeunpf6c6y8o.png)\n\n[Click to view a large map of medical facilities in the UK and France (new window).](/)\n\n**Stationary Hospitals**\n\n*These were smaller hospitals, generally based in forward areas.*\n\n**Casualty Clearing Stations**\n\n*These were small hospitals, generally located at a railhead or similar transportation hub in forward areas. Their job was to provide emergency treatment and to move casualties back to the stationary and general hospitals.*\n\n**Convalescent and Command Depots**\n\n*Convalescent or Command Depots were half way houses for casualties returning to the front — men who no longer required hospitalisation but were not yet fit to rejoin their units. They also were known as ‘Convalescent Homes’.*\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541575170/mvcurmxzekovc0zm11sd.png)\n\nThis diagram depicts the theoretical distribution and disposal of Australian\n sick and wounded arriving in the UK.

While the evacuation system followed this general plan, in practice medical facilities were placed where they could best carry out their tasks under the exigencies of the operational situation. RAP = Regimental Aid Post (the unit-level medical support facility, eg in a battalion).

Germany did invade on 1 September, and on 3 September Britain and France declared war.\n\nAustralia was a British nation. People in Australia were opposed to German expansion, but they were also very closely tied to Britain. When the British Government declared war, Prime Minister Menzies announced that ‘Australia was also at war’.\n\nWith the coming of war, Australia had to make a decision: whether to look after home defence (there was a fear that Japan might try and expand its power), or to commit troops to help England. Japan had pledged its neutrality, and England had assured Australia that it was secure from Japan - the British naval base at Singapore would stop any Japanese advance towards Australia. So Australia committed itself to a European War.\n\nAustralia was not well-prepared to fight a war, and in this early part of the war Prime Minister Menzies stressed that it was ‘Business As Usual’ while an effective force and supply system were developed. The Royal Australian Navy was put under the control of the British; the Army began recruiting and training men; and RAAF men were promised to help the Royal Air Force.",

In the Battle of Britain, Germany’s Luftwaffe tried to control the skies so it could launch a sea-borne invasion of Britain. However this tactic failed. Germany concentrated on bombing British cities, while the British attacked German supply centres.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541577161/px5ranz7yq84crk3jzwb.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

These men flew hundreds of dangerous missions eventually striking at the heart of Germany itself. When Russia and the USA entered the war during 1941, Germany faced overwhelming opposition. On D Day, 6 June 1944, the Allies launched an invasion of Europe from the west. At the same time Russia pushed towards Germany from the east. Germany finally surrendered on 8 May 1945.",

The biggest test came against the German troops who were trying to take the port of Tobruk, a strategically important area. Allied troops, including many thousands of Australians, dug in and were able to hold off repeated and determined attacks. The Germans had contemptuously referred to the defenders as 'rats' in their holes - the Australians took on this title with pride, and called themselves the 'Rats of Tobruk'.

It was also seeking to create a great Empire in Asia. It launched invasions of Thailand and Malaya, and attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. The United States was the only country with sufficient naval power to oppose Japan in the Pacific - but the Japanese missed their most vital target in the Pearl Harbour attack, the American aircraft carriers.\n\nThe Japanese soon fought their way down the Malayan Peninsula to Singapore, the supposedly mighty British fortress which would stop them. Singapore fell in February 1942 and thousands of Allied troops, including over 15,000 Australians, became prisoners of the Japanese. The Japanese advance towards Australia was eventually stopped in New Guinea, first by our own soldiers and then with the help of American forces.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541643404/osnoc0z9rqefmwyw3rvr.png)\nMAP OF BORNEO\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541643434/tlbc49v4i5rqqqvneaus.png)\nMAP OF NEW GUINEA AREA\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541643453/zbl2yx1inubbc4pihkvn.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Women did essential work in factories but most did not receive equal pay, although they did the same work as men. Wives, sisters and mothers, aided by the Women’s Land Army, took up the burden on farms as thousands of farmers went overseas. However the main role for most women continued to be that of home maker, a job made much harder and more demanding by the blackouts, rationing, shortages and the tragedies of wartime life.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541644243/mdmsoeudsnx2skzrux4g.png)\n\nThe hospital ship Centaur, which was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine off the east coast of Australia.

At times of greatest crises - such as the bombing of Darwin and the shelling of Sydney and Newcastle by Japanese submarines - some Australians acted selfishly by hoarding goods, or ignoring what was best for the community as a whole. But most Australians on the homefront did voluntary work, accepted shortages and discomforts, and supported the troops in the struggle for victory.",

An estimated 8031 died in captivity as Prisoners-of-War (POWs) of the Japanese.\n\nSome 13000 Australian POWs were transported to Burma and Thailand to work on the 420 kilometre Burma–Thailand Railway where nearly 2650 Australians died -- from disease, deprivation and horrendous brutality at the hands of their captors.\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541670947/tanzlsxmzuqe7xmrdvyj.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The excavation of soil and rock was carried out using 8 lb hammers, steel tap drills, explosives, pinch bars, picks, shovels and chunkels (a wide hoe). For a short time an air compressor and jack hammers were used. The bulk of the waste rock was removed by hand, using cane baskets and rice sacks slung on two poles. In an attempt to complete the section on schedule, for the six weeks leading up to its completion in mid August, prisoners were forced to work 12 to 18 hour shifts around the clock, without a rest day. The Hellfire Pass section of the Burma–Thailand Railway cost the lives of at least 700 Allied POWs, including 69 beaten to death by Japanese engineers or Korean guards.**\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541670972/t1mh5oytjrht3qqoin9k.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?

In theory the Japanese ration scale for POWs on the railway included 680 gm of rice, 520 gm of vegetables and 110 gm of meat or fish per man per day. At one stage at the 105 km camp in Burma, the rations were so short that meals consisted of rice and boiled chilli water. In Thailand, for the month of February 1943, Dunlop’s O and P Battalions were entitled to 3212 kg of meat and 18,000 kg of vegetables. They actually received 300 kg of meat and 4500 kg of vegetables.**\n\n![text](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1541671008/ok0nlkjs2n9d8nuoqnwn.png)\n\nLike to copy this image?
