Each has one vote but may nominate up to two representatives.\n\nThey comprise a broad cross-section of the community:\n\n- Pastoral — the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Uniting Churches.\n- Civic — The Brisbane City Council, the Queensland Department of Education and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n- Civil — The Royal United Services Institute of Queensland Incorporated, Toc H Australia Northern Region Incorporated and the Queensland Country Women’s Association.\n- Welfare — Defence Force Welfare Association, Salvation Army Red Shield Defence Services, and Australia War Widows (Queensland) Incorporated.\n- Service — Defence Joint Operations Support Services.\n- Ex-Service — The Council of Ex-Servicewomen’s Association, the Naval Association of Australia Incorporated, the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia Incorporated, the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans’ Association Incorporated and the Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia Incorporated.\n\nQueensland’s unique ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has been a proudly non-aligned citizens’ organisation since its inception in 1916.\n\nToday it continues to prosecute the original aims for a \"holy day\" of commemoration rather than another public holiday festival.\n\nIt is a most successfully-managed and effective business which has survived because it is keeping abreast of modern business practices and capitalising on society’s patriotic resurgence.\n\nThe ADCC must endure because it will always represent the citizens’ gift of the people to Queensland’s war veterans.\n\nYou can also find out about the [ADCC Logo](/adcc-logo), our [Annual Badge Appeal](/proud-sponsors-of-the-annual-queensland-anzac-day-badge-appeal) or read a short history of the [ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee](/a-gift-of-the-people).\n\n![anzac day](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540887723/bralodxoiplhowl49bns.png)\n\nThe ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee as a registered charitable organisation is registered with the Australian Governments Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission (ACNC) and as such is permitted to display the ACNC [tick](http://www.acnc.gov.au/).\n\nThe ACNC has developed the [Tick](http://www.acnc.gov.au/) of Charity Registration for registered charities to show the public that they are registered with the ACNC.

      "content": "From its inception in 1916, the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee has assumed the responsibility for educating the nation’s youth about the origins of ANZAC Day and for imparting the enduring lessons of self-sacrifice, mateship, perseverance, courage, devotion to duty and fidelity in the face of overwhelming odds that sprang from example of the men who fought at Gallipoli on the 25th day of April 1915, and which has been demonstrated ever after by those who serve their nation in time of war and peace.\n\nTo that end, an essay competition was conducted in 2015 to invite school students to express “What ANZAC Day Means To Me”.\n\n### ANZAC ESSAYS WIN TRIP OF A LIFETIME\n\n**The 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 2015 will always hold a very special place in the hearts and minds of two lucky children from Outback Queensland.**\n\nAiden Webster and Grace Peskett, both from Cunnamulla in south-western Queensland, entered an ANZAC Day research and essay competition conducted via Paroo Shire Council’s Cunnamulla Library.\n\nLibrarian, Tammy Hickey — assisted by teacher, Marg McLaren — saw this competition as a way to teach a younger generation all about the courage and sacrifices of our soldiers in a time when the world was at war.\n\nStudents were asked to research the events that inspired the legend of the ANZACs, to complete a quiz and write a 200-word essay entitled, “What ANZAC Day Means to Me”.\n\nAiden and Grace were judged the winners and their very strong family ties to World War I were amply demonstrated with their respective entries.\n\nA trip to Brisbane was the prize. And what a prize it was! With the help of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee each attended the Brisbane ANZAC Day Dawn Service and lay a wreath before witnessing just how the city honours The Fallen and holds dear all those who continue to defend our nation’s freedom.\n\nExtras on the trip included attending the Cosentino show at QPAC and meeting him after the show; enjoying a performance of Cirque Du Soleil; a lunchtime river cruise; a tour of the State Library of Queensland's Distant Lines exhibition — including a “white gloves” tour of war memorabilia; and a visit to the Amberley Aviation Heritage display.\n\n“Aiden and Grace met so many inspiring people during their Brisbane visit and will take many longlasting and cherished memories back to their family, friends and community in Cunnamulla,” Ms Hickey said.\n\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/qnwgwzfsfiimu3vegweh.pdf)\n-- [What ANZAC Day Means to Me -- Essay 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540951520/ttdawytaho67o3t3aetd.pdf)\n\n**In Pictures --**\n\nPhoto---> Aiden and Grace with ADCC President Arthur Burke OAM\nPhoto---> Aiden and Grace after Wreath Laying\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Themes</strong> -- Themes collection page..</div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/themes\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Wars</strong> -- Collection of Wars history page..</div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/wars\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Interactives</strong> -- Interactives collection page..</div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/interactives\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Memorials</strong> -- Learn about some of the many memorials erected in Australia and other countries honouring Australian service personnel.</div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/war-memorials\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Medals</strong> - A display of some of the medals awarded to Australian service personnel.</div>\n<div class=\"col-auto\"><a class=\"view-attachment\" href=\"/medals\">Read More</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row d-flex align-items-center py-3 mx-0 list-group-item\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-9 mb-4 mb-sm-0\"><strong>Classroom Activities</strong> - A selection of activities for upper primary and secondary pupils.

In 1914, Australia had a population of fewer than 5 million, yet 300,000 from all walks of life volunteered to fight. Of these, more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner.Just Soldiers by Darryl Kelly\n\nThrough these stories, based on fact, the author has endeavoured to capture the essence of those who served Australia as members of the 1st Australian Imperial Force in the Great War of 1914-1918. As in life, not all were heroes. Illustrated with B&W images to depict the conditions under which these Australians lived and fought.\n\nNB: All rights reserved.

Stand alone. Lawrence Walter Barber was born in February 1894 and some might say he was destined to be a soldier. He was raised in the Sydney suburb of Granville and joined the compulsory, military cadet scheme at the age of 12.\n\n*As the line was re-established, B Company, 36th Battalion moved forward. When Captain Gadd reached the beleaguered Lewis gun position, he found Barber slumped against the gun with his face in his hands, totally exhausted. He was the sole survivor.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Captain Frank Bethune, MC](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540957812/h82cjirz8mlct5pcanpd.pdf). Fight to the death. Frank Pogson Bethune was a quiet, unassuming clergyman from Tasmania. He enlisted in the AIF in Hobart on the 1 July 1915 with the rank of second lieutenant. For reasons of his own, Frank chose to take up arms instead of serving as a padre.\n\n*And hold they did, for 18 days the section repulsed attack after attack. They were subjected to constant artillery barrages of high explosive, shrapnel and gas shells, but they held their ground.*\n\n<hr/> \n\n[Major Percy Black, DSO, DCM](). On 13 September 1914, Percy Charles Herbert Black, a 34-year-old Victorian, enlisted in the AIF in Western Australia where he had been prospecting for gold. He commenced his military career at the Blackboy Hill Camp near Perth as a member of the machine-gun section of the 16th Battalion.\n\n*‘…the bravest and coolest of all the brave men I know.’*\n\n <hr/>\n\n[Trooper Sloan ‘Scotty’ Bolton, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kwewcfdyt7fdivrc54o2.pdf). The Beersheba charger. Allocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area.\n\n*Pushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard.   [Read more about Trooper Bolton.](/trooper-sloan-scotty-bolton-dcm)*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[WO2 Noel Eric Bolton-Wood](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ziu5feezbnj7pnjhyy3t.pdf). Age no barrier. Armed with a bogus letter of consent—supposedly written by his mother—the boy presented himself for enlistment in the AIF.1 The recruiting sergeant eyed him up and down suspiciously. ‘How old did you say you are, young fella?’ he asked.\n\n*Eric was a natural soldier and soon after being posted to the corps he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.2 At the tender age of only 16, Eric reputedly would be the youngest sergeant in the AIF.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Captain Benjamin Brodie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/cwirttcoygstrbitmfxn.pdf). The raider. Benjamin Greenup Brodie was a stalwart of the unit. He had enlisted as a private and from the earliest days displayed the leadership qualities that led to his rapid promotion through the ranks.\n\n*The men listened intently as he presented the plan in intricate detail. After each was assigned his task, the CO looked at the captain and said, ‘Brodie, you’ll be leading our blokes’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Gunner Robert Buie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/sjzxvus4caqjocniuyvq.pdf). Baron beware. Robert Buie was born in the little village of Brooklyn, New South Wales. He earned his livelihood fishing the waters of the Hawkesbury River, then selling his catch to markets in and around North Sydney.\n\n*As the two planes headed towards the Digger, he concentrated his sights on the second aircraft, muttering under his breath, ‘Break right. Break right’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lance Corporal Charles Bunney](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/dmgs1srryed1q6d0naci.pdf). Unmarked but not forgotten. As revellers at home ushered in the 20th century, young soldiers representing the various states of Australia were pitched in battle against the Dutch-Afrikaner settlers, thousands of miles away on the South African veldt.\n\n*Bunney, hearing the commotion, went to investigate. As Bunney entered the room, the blood-splattered Johnson attacked, striking him on the head with the axe.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Corporal Ernest Corey, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/hsffbfax6lgdjjf9jzyc.pdf). One of a kind. Ernest Albert Corey was born in December 1891 at Green Hills, a small town nestled in the shadow of the Snowy Mountains. A lively lad, he grew up as one of eight children born to the family.\n\nThe stretcher-bearer crawled to the wounded Digger. Assessing the situation, he grabbed the man’s thumb and rammed it into the gaping bullet hole in his leg to stem the bleeding while he ripped open a shell dressing.\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Trooper Albert 'Tibby' Cotter](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/falm3zwouzpsyyeawa9k.pdf). The last test. Albert Cotter was born in Sydney on 3 December 1884.1 He lived with his parents in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe. From a young age, he answered to the nickname ‘Tibby’ and, like all boys, he enjoyed fishing and knocking about with his mates. But his one great passion was cricket.\n\n*The two adversaries faced each other from a little more than twenty metres. The sweat stung as it rolled down their brows and into their eyes. One contemplated his attack, the other his defence.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Lance Corporal Francis Curran, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/bynaadjfk5lseh9fcxbu.pdf). The bomber. Francis Patrick Curran was born in Tenterfield, New South Wales, in 1887. On joining the workforce, he became a carter and postman by trade. Young Frank was also a very keen sportsman, excelling at football and boxing. In September 1914, Australia, now at war by virtue of being a member of the British Commonwealth, called for volunteers to join a military force to go to Europe to fight the German oppressors.\n\n*With the skill and athleticism of an A-grade cricketer, the khaki-clad figure repeatedly fielded the hissing bombs in mid air as they flew towards him. With no time to hesitate, yet with deadly accuracy, he hurled them back to their senders.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Bombardier Cecil Edwards, MM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/d2uo1vmvcosmtw73h7s1.pdf). The artillery signaller. Cecil Francis Edwards was barely nineteen when Great Britain declared war on Germany. Cec was among the first to join the long queues of young Australian men eager to volunteer to serve their King and country.\n\n*The concussion of exploding shells rocked their senses. The screech of artillery fired from the field guns of both sides was deafening . . . but communications had to be maintained.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[2Lt Henry ‘Ernie’ Eibel](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ifqlidcdefvzgfpobrx5.pdf). The iceberg. On 21 September 1914, barely six weeks after the outbreak of the First World War, Henry ‘Ernie’ Eibel enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Like so many of the early volunteers, Ernie was a country lad.\n\n*Long, black belts of thick barbed wire formed a formidable barrier. Beyond the wire were reinforced concrete pillboxes, the deadly barrels of machine-guns jutting from the openings. The air was thick with bullets and the red-hot splinters of artillery rounds.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Edward Elart](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/ciebdhqbyiro4qk5lklq.pdf). A man with a secret. As eager young volunteers skirted around him, a young man paused and stared intently at the building that housed Naval Headquarters. He was poised to go in, but, on the threshold, he changed his mind. Instead, he turned on his heel and headed towards the military barracks down the road, where some time later he stood before the officer, raised his right hand and pledged, ‘I, Edward Elart, do hereby swear…‘\n\n*On the night of 6 June, he was ordered to go out again. ‘I’ll need a couple of blokes to go with me’, Freame said. A newly arrived lad by the name of Morris said he’d go and the other volunteer was Edward Elart.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Sergeant ‘Harry’ Freame, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/xji8hzbviw3aoptg0ick.pdf). The ANZAC ‘Bushido’. Harry Freame was born in 1880 in the Japanese city of Osaka. His parents were William Freame, an Australian working in Japan as an English teacher, and Shizu Kitagawa, whose Japanese ancestry dated back to the Shoguns of the 16th century.\n\n*Then, knowing that the information he had gathered was required by his commanding officer, Freame sprinted down the valley, drawing a furious hail of Turkish rifle and machine-gun fire as he went.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Chaplain Alfred Goller](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kyjieuynfcusrmsfugot.pdf). The insubordinate padre. Alfred Ernest Goller was born in Bannockburn, Victoria in July 1883. His parents were simple people with strong religious convictions, who had raised their son with the same set of values. Until the outbreak of war in 1914, he served the church in the Victorian country areas of Birchip and Mia Mia.\n\n*The commanding officer (CO) said, ‘You can fall out too, Padre'. ' No Sir’, was the reply. ‘If ever the men needed a chaplain, they need one now’.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[2Lt Robert Graham, DCM](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/kuhdn1akgmtoe2puhlgl.pdf). The soldier of fortune. Robert Louis Graham was born in Canada on 16 April 1876. The son of a superior criminal court judge, he spent much of his vacation time as a youngster among the friendly Indian tribes of central Canada.\n\n*When Bob Graham presented himself for enlistment in the AIF, the crusty old sergeant manning the desk asked, ‘Have you had any military experience, mate?’ ‘Yeah, a bit’, Graham replied.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private John ‘Barney’ Hines](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/wtfnnheyiov12fygme5b.pdf). The souvenir king. Born in Liverpool, England, Hines gave his age as 36 and his occupation as comprising a variety of trades—seaman, engineer, fireman, deep-sea diver and shearer. This was not Barney’s first experience of military life.\n\n*Later that day, Hines ventured out alone and destroyed another German machine-gun post. He was wounded during this latter action and spent the next six weeks recuperating in hospital.*\n\n<hr/>\n\n[Private Edwin Hoare](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540958339/n2lxew2kyeobamtlifgj.pdf). Sorry mother. Edwin Cooper Hoare was British, born and bred. He worked hard as a fruit farmer to help support his parents. At the end of a hard day’s work, the young lad often wandered through the fields that surrounded his home in Hastings.

      "content": "## The Beersheba Charger\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\nIn the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n\n![beersheba charger](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966655/iko3pwguzb8rgb6cx2ho.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

New recruits to the AIF pause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n\n![bolton](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966932/obb5ng89z6vjtbdahwh6.jpg)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n\n![painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966983/f1uhyanvjxttzb1lmvwv.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![beersheba painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967034/kk0uu2ya3uczn22pe9fs.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n\n![beersheba charge](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967116/wh788toyzuetdv1y7unw.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n\n![beersheba map](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967193/kds7eptf2yfpbtrqh60l.jpg)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres.

It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n\n![Scotty and his wife, Elsie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967358/k0dmuwblovdqtc2rcieq.jpg)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

          "content": "## The Beersheba Charger\n\nAdapted from a story by Darryl Kelly in Just Soldiers.\n\nIn the frenzied patriotic fervour that greeted the outbreak of World War I, the cream of Australia’s youth rushed the recruiting depots across the nation. In the Victorian city of Geelong, a fresh-faced 21-year-old engine driver with a distinct Irish accent took the oath to serve his adopted country. His name was Sloan Bolton, although he preferred to be known by his quirky nickname, ‘Scotty’.\n\nAllocated initially to the 14th Infantry Battalion, Scotty Bolton was sent to the vast training camp that sprawled like a small city over most of the Broadmeadows area. On their arrival, Scotty and the other new recruits were tasked to rig their tents. They were a bell-shaped design, meant to sleep four men, but to their amazement they were to be the sleeping quarters for ten men. Sleeping on the cold hard ground proved difficult for the recruits on their first night. Scotty was initially allocated to B Company, but the day after his arrival, he was, to his surprise, assigned to the military police (MPs). He was even more astounded to learn this posting was for 14 weeks. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe primary role of the MPs was to watch the hotels and discourage the Diggers from becoming drunk. Secretly, Scotty would have preferred to be one of those being watched. He despised his role as a policeman and applied to return to B Company but it was too late as the battalion had a new commander.\n\n\n![beersheba charger](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966655/iko3pwguzb8rgb6cx2ho.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image? Please click [here](/awm-images) first\n\n**AWM A05741. Broadmeadows, Vic, 20 October 1914. New recruits to the AIF pause for a mug of tea during training in camp.**\n\nIn an adjacent camp, within sight of the infantry soldiers, were the light horse regiments. Scotty noted with deepening interest the cocky swagger of the troopers and the spit and polish of their leather as they rode their Walers over the grassy paddocks.\n\nEventually, driven by envy and inspired by the sight that greeted him daily, Scotty applied for a transfer to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which was designated as Divisional Cavalry. His request granted, Scotty became a member of a unit that saw itself as one of Victoria’s finest.\n\nBolton soon received his first taste of the grand overseas adventure for which he had volunteered. The 4th Light Horse went into training in a makeshift camp spread across the shifting sands of Egypt, in the shadows of the pyramids. Here the light horsemen sharpened their skills and refined that fighting prowess later to make them famous. In their off-duty hours the troopers indulged in the sights, sounds and various forms of entertainment that nearby Cairo had to offer.\n\nNo sooner had the sands of Egypt acquired a familiar feel than there was a stirring within the Division. The camp was awash with rumours of impending action. Stores were packed, orders were despatched, the soldiers were on the move. Just as the excitement reached fever pitch, the troopers of the light horse were told they were to remain in Egypt. Their disappointment was tangible. Irritated by the jeers of the departing infantry, Scotty pondered his decision to transfer to the light horse—had he relinquished his only chance of taking part in this war? Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nBut the infantry had not faired well at Gallipoli and urgent reinforcements were needed. The light horsemen were to get their chance, but as infantry—the horses were unsuited to the terrain of the Gallipoli Peninsula so would stay behind in Egypt.\n\nThe 4th Light Horse landed in Gallipoli in early June 1915 and the troopers quickly realised that they had arrived on Hell’s doorstep. Scotty was to spend his first, but sleepless night at Gallipoli on the slopes of a place aptly named Dead Man’s Valley.Note 4 AWM 8, Unit Embarkation Nominal Rolls, 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nDisease was rife amid the squalor of the ANZAC trenches, with a large proportion of casualties the victims of dysentery and diarrhoea, rather than the bullets fired by Johnny Turk. Characteristically loath to report sick, many soldiers attempted to hide their illness, others had to accept that evacuation to a hospital was the grim eventuality.\n\nThe ANZAC Diggers firmly believed that leaving the line was akin to deserting their mates. Bolton, almost crippled by disease, fought on until late August when he could barely stand and eventually had to be evacuated as far as the 2nd Australian General Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. Two weeks later he was released from the hospital and sent to the reinforcement depot at Helouan on light duties.\n\nThe 4th left the Peninsula on 11 December 1914. Back in Egypt, as they licked their wounds, the troopers faced the grim reality that 41 of their own lay beneath the rugged landscape of Gallipoli.\n\nTrooper Bolton rejoined his regiment on 2 January 1916, but the reunion was short-lived as Scotty was again stricken with disease—on 6 January he was readmitted to the hospital with mumps.\n\nIn early 1916, the 4th Light Horse was split to serve on two fronts. Two squadrons were despatched to fight the Hun on the Western Front, while Scotty and the other troopers remained in the Middle East—convinced they were destined to be held perpetually in reserve or used to perform odd jobs at the whim of the British High Command.\n\nDisease and sickness, particularly malaria, continued to spread through the light horse ranks. Yet again, Scotty Bolton fell victim. On his release from the hospital, Scotty returned to find the Desert Mounted Corps had been engaged in successive, but unsuccessful, attacks on the Turkish bastion of Gaza. General Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Palestine, now turned his attention to the nearby town of Beersheba.\n\n\n![bolton](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966932/obb5ng89z6vjtbdahwh6.jpg)\n\n**Bolton astride favourite mount, ‘Monty’. (Family collection)**\n\nThe strategic value lay not only in its proximity to Gaza, but also in the huge wells within its precincts. (Water, as always, remained the currency of the Middle East. In the deserts of Palestine, wells were marked and valued in terms of the number of camels they could water. Some wells were marked as 100, some 1000, but the wells of Beersheba were marked as unlimited.)  Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\n‘Z’ Day was scheduled for 31 October 1917. On the afternoon of the 28th, Bolton was among the crowds of troopers who stood before the canvas water troughs, urging their mounts to drink. Their desperation was fuelled by uncertainty—the next source of water was by no means assured and might be more than a day’s ride away. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the 4th, Lieutenant Colonel ‘Swagman Bill’ Bourchier, screwed up his orders. Clutching the crumpled paper in his hand, he scowled at his officers. It seemed the 4th was designated reserve yet again.\n\nIn the cool, clear night, the lines of horsemen, four abreast, moved out. The snakelike column of regiment behind regiment extended for more than 16 kilometres. They rode all that night and into the next day. When they finally came to a grinding halt, the engineers moved out to assemble the watering troughs. They stopped in their tracks as the order came to mount up again. The troopers’ angst increased as they forced their thirsty horses on through the night.\n\n\n![painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540966983/f1uhyanvjxttzb1lmvwv.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Beersheba glimmered, a veritable treasure trove, shining in the early morning sunlight. Like all hoards of riches, however, Beersheba was well guarded—two fortified hills, bristling with strong points, covered the approaches to the town.\n\nAny attack against Beersheba was precluded by the dangerous necessity to secure these two hills. Tel el Saba would be attacked by the New Zealanders, while Tel el Sakati would be the 2nd Light Horse Brigade’s objective. The remainder of the horsemen would have to sweat out the day in a dust-filled wadi beneath the blazing sun of Palestine.\n\n![beersheba painting](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967034/kk0uu2ya3uczn22pe9fs.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

Depicts the men and horses of the 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade encountering Turkish trenches and defending Turkish soldiers. A tangled mass of wounded and dying horses and soldiers is shown against the backdrop of a barren and undulating landscape. The buildings of Beersheba are just visible to the left on the horizon.**\n\nThe battle for the guardian hills ebbed and flowed throughout the afternoon in a vicious cycle of hand-to-hand combat. By late afternoon the entire plan hung precariously in the balance. If Beersheba could not be taken soon, the action would have to be abandoned. Some horses had been without water for more than 60 hours and it was 12 hours’ ride to the next well capable of watering the force.\n\nThe commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, the legendary Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, assembled his commanders on the hill overlooking the stark plain. Together they dissected the situation, looking for answers. The commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Brigadier William Grant, boldly proposed an audacious plan that boasted as its coup de main a massive cavalry charge.\n\nTwo regiments, the 4th and the 12th would thunder across the plain and charge the city. Chauvel pondered the situation for a moment. The time was now 4 pm and the sun would set at 4.50. With a furrowed brow, he gave his assent. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nWhile Grant and his commanders looked for an area to form up for the charge, the regimental sergeant major galloped along the wadi calling his men to prepare for action. Bolton tightened the girth on his horse, took a final gulp of water from his bottle and mounted. The regiments moved out into a patch of dead ground on the plain. With mounting astonishment mixed with feverish excitement, the troopers realised that they were about to attempt one of the great cavalry charges of modern times—an attack on Beersheba.\n\n\n![beersheba charge](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967116/wh788toyzuetdv1y7unw.jpg)\n\nLike to copy this image?

The charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, taken by a Turk whose camera was captured later in the day.**\n\nThe 4th Light Horse formed up on the right, with the 12th on the left. The 11th was still attempting to reach the plain and would form the depth regiment, if it arrived in time. Bourchier would lead both regiments in this eleventh hour bid. Facing the 800 horsemen were 4400 soldiers, supported by 28 field guns and a deadly mass of machine-guns.\n\n\n![beersheba map](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967193/kds7eptf2yfpbtrqh60l.jpg)\n\nBourchier glanced at his watch, the time had come. He raised his arm above his head and waved it forward in one slow, deliberate motion. The horses stepped off. He gave the signal for the trot, then two minutes later, the canter.\n\nIn the presumed safety of their trenches, the German non-commissioned officers calmly gave their orders to the Turkish soldiers. Being familiar with the light horse tactics, they ordered their soldiers to wait until the light horsemen dismounted before opening fire.\n\nAt a distance of two and a half kilometres from the forward trenches, Bourchier commanded his men to charge. The steady canter of the horsemen reached the crescendo of the gallop and, hooves thundering, they bore down mercilessly on their hapless foe in a deadly, destructive wave.\n\nAs the horsemen surged forward, the Turkish batteries opened fire with a mixture of shrapnel and high explosive. The projectiles burst among the forward ranks. Men were blown from their saddles and some horses fell, but the charge did not falter. The Turkish gunners watched the charge, lowering the barrels of their guns, waiting for the dismount that never came. Suddenly the Light Horse regiments were below the trajectory of the guns. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nPushing his Waler at full gallop, Trooper Bolton reached down and grasped the handle of his bayonet, extracting the 18-inch blade from its scabbard. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turks now set their rifle sights to a range of 1600 metres as the riflemen and machine-gunners readied themselves. The volley of lead cut through the lines of horsemen, but the thirsty horses could smell the water—there was no stopping them.\n\nBolton’s horse, Monty, careered wildly and he fought hard to regain control of his plunging beast. He was later to find that a bullet had narrowly missed his own leg, hitting instead the pannikin hanging from the saddle. This had deflected the round, carving a 12-inch gouge along the horse’s rump. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nThe Turkish riflemen fired wildly at the approaching horde. At the sight of the rampaging Australians, some Turks threw down their weapons and ran towards the town, others chose to fight to the end. The defenders were ordered to save the guns and the Turkish horse teams galloped forward to salvage what they could.\n\nThe first wave of the light horse now reached the forward enemy line. As the horses leaped across the open trenches, many of the Turks crouched and thrust their rifles and bayonets upward to disembowel the horses in mid-flight. The remnants of the first wave carried on to engage the support trenches. The scene had become a bloody shambles of rifle and revolver fire. The rip and slash of wielded bayonets punctuated the air and one horse was seen to join the fight, rearing and striking out with its fore-hooves. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nScotty galloped through to the second line, attacking two Turks with his bayonet. As he rode towards the centre of town, he spotted a Turkish soldier running towards a house. Galloping over, Bolton kicked the Turk, forcing him to the ground, retrieving his revolver as he lay dazed. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nElements of the 12th Light Horse were already weaving their way through the streets, and some were watering their horses in the captured wells. One trooper fell to his knees in a Turkish canvas water trough, and drank side-by-side with his horse. Note 5. Jones I, The Australian Light Horse, Time-Life Books Australia in association with John Ferguson, Sydney, 1987.\n\nSuddenly a well exploded, then another and yet another, the last blast almost throwing Bolton from his horse. On the ground he noticed a number of wires leading to a building. Bolton peered through an open window and caught sight of a German officer operating a switchboard. He sprang from the saddle and burst through the door. The startled German tightened his grip on the detonation handle. Bolton cocked his revolver and put it to the German’s forehead, overcoming the language barrier with one decisive stroke. Bolton’s mate, Trooper Ray Hudson, came through the door and took charge of the prisoner.1 Although some wells had been destroyed and a few had been damaged, most were still intact, including reservoirs holding more than 400000 litres.

It is believed that it was in the basement of this building that Bolton captured the German demolition officer. (Author’s collection)**\n\nDarkness was now settling over the captured town. Scotty emerged from the building into the growing dusk and remounted. A sudden movement caught his eye and, turning in his saddle, he saw a Turkish field gun and its six-man detachment, led by a German officer, galloping away from the town.\n\nDigging his spurs into the Waler’s side, he set off in pursuit of the gun, calling for help from an Australian officer who was dismounted nearby. He rode up alongside the German officer and called for him to halt, but was ignored. Scotty took aim, pulled the trigger and heard the click of the empty chamber.\n\nHe then moved in closer and hit the German over the head, but, as the German was wearing a helmet, this did no more than hurt Bolton’s hand and dent his pride. Next he thrust the butt of the revolver in the German’s face, knocking him to the ground. Grabbing the reins of the lead horse, he slowed the team to a halt. Maintaining his bluff, he kept the Turks covered with the empty revolver, while the Australian officer rode up and took charge of the prisoners.\n\nAs they returned with their prize, retreating Turks threw down their weapons and joined Bolton’s party. By the time they reached the town square, their numbers had swelled to more than 30.1 For his actions, Scotty Bolton was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, with a citation that hailed his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.

Turkish soldiers, threatened by Arabs, seek refuge with ALH units before formally surrendering to them. **\n\nDespite the ferocity of the attack, the casualties suffered by both regiments were relatively light, with only 31 killed and 36 wounded, most as a result of the savage hand-to-hand combat in the trenches. Note 6. AWM 28, Recommendation Files for Honours and Awards, AIF, 1914–1918 War.\n\nWith the fall of Beersheba, the Desert Mounted Column forged its way across Palestine, the Turkish resistance crumbling in their wake. Gaza fell a week later, the River Jordan was crossed and Jerusalem captured.\n\nAfter spending the first months of 1918 resting and training, in March and April, the 4th took part in raids against the towns of Amman and Es Salt. However, a number of natural fortresses denied victory to the troopers: Red Hill, Black Hill, and the most vital—Table Top.\n\nTable Top was a myriad of rocky outcrops and sheer slopes. The light horsemen eyed the fortress with a steely resolve. The defenders were equally determined to fight them off. Bolton checked and rechecked his rifle and ammunition. He drew his bayonet from its scabbard and fitted it to the weapon, laying out his three Mills bombs on the edge of his pit. Mentally, he urged the enemy to counter attack, daring them to show their faces. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family. Note 7. The Mills bomb was a heavy fragmentation grenade.\n\nEarsplitting screams punctuated the deluge of rifle and machine-gun fire as the Turks attacked. The troopers returned fire but soon found their ammunition all but exhausted. The pins were pulled on the Mills bombs and these were hurled at the relentless attackers. When the bombs ran out, the troopers resorted to rocks, taking pot shots at the Turks with any projectile that came to hand. Finally, the attack faltered, and the Turks began to withdraw. Along the light horse line, the order came to pursue the retreating attackers.\n\nScotty needed no urging. As he scampered in pursuit, he was enveloped in the dust and smoke of a sudden explosion and found himself rolling wildly and blindly down the hill. He pushed himself up with one hand, only to fall again—his left leg was now a mangled, bloody mess.\n\nCrawling to gain cover behind a rock, Bolton felt his life draining away with each pulse from his severed arteries as he called plaintively for a stretcher-bearer. While he waited, he tried to administer some sort of first aid, then he realised that his right leg was also severely injured. Scotty was sure that this was the end. As he lapsed into unconsciousness, he heard the reassuring voice of a mate. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nFor days Bolton hovered precariously between life and death. One cold, still morning, he opened his eyes to be greeted by a pretty Australian nursing sister. He was in a hospital in El Arish. As he surveyed his surroundings, he noticed the cage that encompassed the lower portion of his body. The nursing sister followed his eyes and the look on her face told him the grim truth. He had lost both his legs. Note 8. From family notes, graciously provided by Mrs Margaret Grant (née Bolton).\n\nThe troopship pulled into the Melbourne dock to the clamour of bands and the cheers of the waiting crowds. Slowly, the gathering fell silent as the hushed and shocked people parted to allow the long stream of wounded to file through. These men had left Australia young, fit and full of fight. Now they returned blinded and maimed—many lacking limbs. These soldiers now faced a new fight.\n\nScotty spent his convalescence at the Caulfield Repatriation Hospital.3 Here he was fitted with a pair of artificial limbs. The courage he had shown at Beersheba was apparent again as he gritted his teeth and took his first steps with his new legs. Time and again, he was faced by setbacks. His new limbs would rub on the raw skin, the stumps that were once his legs would break down, and gangrene would set in—more surgery to remove the damaged tissue, and back to square one, learning to walk with artificial legs.\n\nOne day, as Scotty faced the daily grind of his exercise regimen, a young wisp of a girl walked in to distribute gifts to the patients. Their eyes met and a smile came to Scotty’s face. Her name was Elsie and he realised they had met before he went on service overseas. The two had exchanged letters during that time, but had remained simply pen pals. As time passed they became inseparable, but Scotty was reluctant to consider the possibility of marriage until he had proven himself capable of walking again. He made a promise to himself and to her. He would fight to regain his mobility; he would not surrender, irrespective of how long it took. He would walk again. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOf the thirty amputees in the ward, Scotty was the only one to walk out. The others lacked Bolton’s determination, accepting life as a cripple—dependent on crutches or confined to a wheelchair.\n\nScotty made many return trips to the hospital, earning the praise of his doctors for his resolve to master his new limbs. On one occasion, he alighted from a tram in front of the hospital, misjudged the gutter, and sprawled on the ground in a helpless tangle. As he struggled to regain his feet, many of the passers-by looked on in disgust, believing him to be yet another drunken veteran. An officer came to his aid, helping him gently to his feet. Scotty noticed the crimson ribbon on the officer’s chest. The Good Samaritan was none other than Captain Rupert Moon VC. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn 20 March 1919, Bolton was discharged from the Australian Imperial Forces. Note 3. National Archives of Australia: B2455, WW1 Service Records, 858 Private Sloan Bolton.\n\nIn 1922, he finally married his beloved Elsie.\n\n\n![Scotty and his wife, Elsie](https://res.cloudinary.com/da3oztzpf/image/upload/v1540967358/k0dmuwblovdqtc2rcieq.jpg)\n\n**Scotty and his wife, Elsie. (Family collection)**\n\nThe postwar years saw the Boltons settle on a property in the Geelong area. Scotty quickly became obsessed with producing the best possible breeds of cattle. At the centenary Melbourne Show of 1934, one of Scotty’s animals won the coveted trophy for champion Jersey bull, establishing the Bolton name at the forefront of the cattle industry.\n\nThe Depression years were difficult times for the vast majority of Australians, but especially hard for the Bolton family. Scotty’s health deteriorated and he was required to make regular trips to hospital for treatment. The old light horse qualities of resourcefulness and self-sacrifice endured, and Scotty battled through the worst of those terrible years, determined to provide the best for his family.\n\nScotty was adamant that all his children should be competent horsemen. A favourite family tale concerned Ruby, a troublesome pony that had provided many a bruising encounter for the young Bolton children, bucking each of them off in turn. Finally, in a fit of frustration, Scotty stumped his way over to the horse, grabbed the reins and hoisted himself into the saddle, determined to show the children how it should be done. Suddenly, Ruby bucked, sending Scotty tumbling to the ground. As he lay grinning stupidly at himself, he realised that the force of the fall had broken one of his artificial legs. The Bolton children would remind their father of his tangle with Ruby for years to come. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1947, as families across Australia rushed to complete last-minute Christmas shopping and children dreamed of the gifts they would receive on Christmas morning, Sloan Bolton, the brave Beersheba charger, fought his last battle. He did not live to greet the dawn of Christmas Day, 1947.\n\nElsie Bolton now took up the challenge and held her family together, only to be dealt another blow six months after Scotty’s death. The Bolton homestead was all but destroyed by fire. Among the treasured possessions lost to the flames were the medals that had been awarded to Scotty.\n\nElsie wrote a heartfelt letter to the Repatriation Department, explaining the loss of the medals. She described particularly the sense of emptiness that the family would feel on ANZAC Day, when other school children displayed medals and ribbons earned by parents and grandparents and yet the children of a proud and decorated veteran such as Sloan Bolton would have none. But Elsie’s request for replacement medals was refused. Mindless bureaucracy had determined that these medals could not be provided once a soldier had died. Note 1. A Dream of the Past, Diary of Trooper Sloan Bolton DCM, privately printed by the family.\n\nIn 1970, during Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Australia, Bolton’s ten-year-old granddaughter, Jenny, wrote to the Queen and asked if she would intervene and have her grandfather’s medals reissued to the family. The Governor General replied to Jenny’s request on the Queen’s behalf and a replacement DCM was forwarded to the family.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story was brought to life on the silver screen in the 1987 film The Light Horsemen. Jon Blake, a well-known Australian actor with a very promising future, was chosen to portray Bolton. He visited Elsie and wrote to her on a number of occasions, keeping her advised of the film’s progress. It seemed, however, that fate had not finished with the Bolton family. At the completion of filming, Blake left the outback film set to return to Adelaide. En route, he was involved in a terrible car accident which left the young actor with severe, irreversible brain damage.\n\nScotty Bolton’s story highlights the courage, resourcefulness and true grit that typified the light horsemen. They were men who routinely faced impossible odds with a wry, laconic humour. They revelled in their reputation for salvaging the most unlikely victory in the face of certain defeat. The legendary cavalry charge at Beersheba now occupies a hallowed place in the annals of Australian legend. Yet Scotty’s story is also the seldom-told story of courage, sacrifice and fierce determination that epitomised the struggle of many soldiers in those hard post-war years. The fight of the crippled and often traumatised soldier and his family to rebuild a normal life is also a story that truly warrants telling.\n\n*Author's note. I would like to thank Scotty’s daughter, Margaret, for her valuable assistance in piecing together her father’s story. The insight provided by his diaries and the family photographs has helped recreate the spirit of Scotty and for that I owe her my deepest gratitude.*\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

Your predecessors in Premier Ryan and Leader of the Opposition James Tomlie were both present at the formation of the Committee on 10th of January 1916, and your presence together today symbolises the fidelity of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee to the non-partisan vision of its founders.\n\nI also acknowledge senior members of our service organisations here in Queensland.\n\nEvery day around our State, new organisations are born, clustered around an idea or worthy goal.\n\nFew survive for a decade, even fewer to mark their centenary.\n\nTo last, organisations must speak to the enduring values that bind us together.\n\nAt that first meeting, 100 years ago, which led to the formation of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, then Governor, Major the Honourable Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, submitted the following motion:\n\n“That the heroic conduct of our gallant Queensland troops during the present war, and especially on that ever-memorable occasion of the landing at Gallipoli on April 25 last, has earned for them undying fame, and deserves the fullest recognition by the people of this country, whose rights and liberties they have been bravely defending.”\n\nHis words seem as strong and enduring as the values that today we call the Spirit of Anzac; of courage, fortitude and looking out for your mates; of honour and service before self.\n\nGovernor Goold-Adams was a veteran of the Boer War who understood the pain of the families of the dead and the missing.\n\n100 years ago he chose to be part of the great project of remembrance.\n\nIt is a project that will forever remain unfinished, and whose work is entrusted to us today.\n\nQueenslanders have never forgotten the bravery and sacrifice of the men who stepped ashore in the cold dawn at Gallipoli, more than a century ago.\n\nIt has been the noble work of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee to shape our experience of the anniversary of that great and terrible day, through the Second World War, through other wars and conflicts, and through the passing of the World War One veterans and their wives.\n\nI am very proud to be the Patron of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, taking my place in the proud succession of Governors who have performed this service to our State.\n\nI am grateful to the members of the Executive Committee and their predecessors, to all the Pastoral, Civic, Civil, Welfare, Service and Ex-Service Organisations who provide representation, and to everyone who serves the Committee’s great purpose.\n\nAs we pause to acknowledge the achievement of 100 years of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee, as your Patron I rededicate myself to working with you ensure that Anzac Day remains a day of gratitude and reflection for all Australians, for another 100 years.\n\nThank you.
